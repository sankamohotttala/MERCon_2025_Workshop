This cognitive framework incorporates Reinforcement Learning, enabling it to dynamically interact with the network environment and continuously update policies for intelligent decision-making in complex 5G networks. The efficacy of the proposed framework is evaluated using an object detection application in smart cities.

They rely on wireless communication to stream the collected data to data centers, which makes them susceptible to bandwidth fluctuations due to extreme weather conditions such as snowstorms. Although these networks are designed to have alternate routes to recover from link failures, existing rigid network management solutions (i.e., OSPF) make it difficult to utilize alternate routes when the bandwidth of wireless links degrades. This paper proposes an adaptive routing algorithm, RENET, to quickly detect bandwidth fluctuations and re-adjust flow paths to increase the utilization of available links. RENET introduces a novel delay-based measurement technique to quickly detect bandwidth fluctuations in wireless links. Experimental results collected in real-world and emulated networks show that RENET offers a robust solution to bandwidth fluctuations and outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by more than $30 \%$ in terms of QoS satisfaction rate.

Consequently, each edge AI application’s bandwidth demand is highly dynamic. Thus, a shared edge system should dynamically allocate more bandwidth to the applications in need to reach high accuracy at each moment. However, previous bandwidth allocators are ill-suited because they are agnostic to the timevarying impact of bandwidth on each application’s accuracy.This short paper explores a new accuracy-driven approach to bandwidth allocation, which periodically re-allocates bandwidth across edge AI applications based on the sensitivity of each application’s accuracy to its bandwidth share. To examine its practical benefit and technical challenges, we present a concrete accuracy-driven bandwidth allocator called ConciERGE, which exposes a simple yet efficient interface to estimate each application’s sensitivity to a small change in its bandwidth share.We run CONCIERGE on state-of-the-art video-analytics applications with real video streams and show its early promise in greatly improving the inference accuracy of video analytics.","2767-9918","979-8-3503-6849-9","10.1109/EDGE62653.2024.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10646431","Resource Allocation;System for ML;ML at Edge;Video Analytic;Network","Accuracy;Sensitivity;Visual analytics;Estimation;Bandwidth;Edge AI;Channel allocation","","","","33","IEEE","28 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, it heavily relies on labeled data for training, and in the absence of labeled data support, traditional knowledge distillation encounters significant hurdles. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the application of knowledge distillation in this field, aiming to improve the performance of lightweight models within unsupervised edge scenarios. We integrate contrastive learning, the currently prevalent self-supervised learning technique, with knowledge distillation to enhance the model’s knowledge distillation task through the assessment of similarity between sample pairs. Concurrently, we utilize a projection head to align features between the student and teacher models, employing the Siamese Classifier method to enable the reuse of the pre-trained classifier in the student model. This obviates the need for retraining the classifier and allows the student to acquire more knowledge from the teacher. A series of experimental results showcases that our model exhibits state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark dataset CIFAR-100, particularly when the ResNet $32 \times 4$ serves as the teacher for instructing the ResNet8 $\times 4$, surpassing other methods on average by $3.8 \%$.","2767-9918","979-8-3503-6849-9","10.1109/EDGE62653.2024.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10646444","edge intelligence;knowledge distillation;contrastive learning;image classification;deep neural networks","Training;Knowledge engineering;Image coding;Image edge detection;Neural networks;Contrastive learning;Streaming media","","","","29","IEEE","28 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To ensure Quality of Service (QoS), individual services must fulfill Service Level Objectives (SLOs); however, SLO fulfillment is dependent on resources (e.g., processing or storage), which are scarcely available within the Edge. Hence, when distributing services over heterogeneous devices, this raises the question of where to deploy each service to best fulfill both its own SLOs as well as those imposed by dependent services. In this paper, we maximize SLO fulfillment of a pipeline-based application by analyzing these dependencies. To achieve this, services and hosting devices alike are extended with a Markov blanket (MB) - a probabilistic view into their internal processes - which are composed into one overarching model. Given a mutable set of services, hosts, and SLOs, the composed MB allows inferring the optimal assignment between services and edge devices. We evaluated our method for a smart city scenario, which assigned pipelined services (e.g., video processing) under constraints from subsequent services (e.g., consumer latency). The results showed how our method can support infrastructure providers by optimizing SLO fulfillment for arbitrary devices currently available.","2767-9918","979-8-3503-6849-9","10.1109/EDGE62653.2024.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10646438","Service Level Objectives;Computing Continuum;Markov Blanket;Quality of Service;Bayesian Networks","Smart cities;Pipelines;Microservice architectures;Quality of service;Probabilistic logic;Internet of Things;Edge computing","","1","","39","IEEE","28 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transferring this data from end-user devices to edge servers leads to increased latency and congestion in the edge network. Since many of the offloaded tasks may require processing the same data items, the task allocation algorithms can exploit this to reduce the traffic in the networks and the number of edge servers needed to execute the tasks. Therefore, in this paper we design online algorithms for task allocation in edge computing systems that take into account the sharing of data among the tasks offloaded to the same server. We perform an extensive performance analysis by comparing our proposed algorithms with several sharing-oblivious baseline algorithms. The results show that our algorithms are able to reduce the amount of data transferred in the network by $30.2 \%$ to $\mathbf{9 2. 8 \%}$ and the number of utilized servers by $\mathbf{1 \%}$ to $82.8 \%$ compared to the sharing-oblivious baseline algorithms.","2767-9918","979-8-3503-6849-9","10.1109/EDGE62653.2024.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10646447","Edge computing;task allocation;online algorithms;data sharing","Performance evaluation;Sensors;Performance analysis;Servers;Resource management;Task analysis;Edge computing","","1","","18","IEEE","28 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While data center scaling continues, inference away from the cloud will increasingly rely on distributed inference on multiple devices. Most prior efforts have focused on optimizing singledevice inference or partitioning models to enhance inference throughput. Meanwhile, energy consumption continues to grow in importance as a factor of consideration. This work proposes a framework that searches for optimal model splits and distributes the partitions across the combination of devices taking into account throughput and energy. Participating devices are strategically grouped into homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters consisting of general-purpose CPU and GPU architectures, as well as emerging Compute-In-Memory (CIM) accelerators. The framework simultaneously optimizes inference throughput and energy consumption. It is able to demonstrate up to $4 \times$ speedup with approximately $4 \times$ per-device energy reduction in a heterogeneous setup compared to single GPU inference. The algorithm also finds a smooth Pareto-like curve in the energy-throughput space for CIM devices.","2767-9918","979-8-3503-6849-9","10.1109/EDGE62653.2024.00027","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10646434","Distributed Inference;Model splitting;Heterogeneous Hardware;Compute-in-memory;Heterogeneous Devices;GPU;CPU;CIM;ReRAM","Performance evaluation;Energy consumption;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Graphics processing units;Computer architecture;In-memory computing","","","","22","IEEE","28 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach leverages differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) to explore a novel search space emphasizing efficient operations over traditional attention mechanisms.
