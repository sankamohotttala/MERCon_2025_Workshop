However, vehicle speeds have not been extensively explored, which may cause mismatching between vehicle speed and its allocated computation and wireless resource. In this paper, we propose a vehicle speed aware task offloading and resource allocation strategy, to decrease the energy cost of executing tasks without exceeding the delay constraint. First, we establish the vehicle speed aware delay constraint model based on different speeds and task types. Then, the delay and energy cost of task execution in VEC server and local terminal are calculated. Next, we formulate a joint optimization of task offloading and resource allocation to minimize vehicles' energy cost subject to delay constraints. MADDPG method is employed to obtain offloading and resource allocation strategy. Simulation results show that our algorithm can achieve superior performance on energy cost and task completion delay.","","978-1-7281-8254-4","10.1109/EDGE50951.2020.00008","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701389,U1903213); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2018JQ6022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284254","vehicular edge computing;vehicle speed;computation offloading;resource allocation;deep reinforcement learning;MADDPG","Wireless communication;Energy consumption;Simulation;Delays;Resource management;Mathematical model;Task analysis","","36","","13","IEEE","17 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we exploit the edge-cloud architecture to design and implement a novel RS image service system, called RS-pCloud, which leverages the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model to integrate multiple data centers and their associated edge networks. The data center as cloud platform is responsible for the storage and processing of original RS images, as well as the storage of partial processed images while the edge network is mainly for caching and sharing the processed images. With this design, RS-pCloud not only achieves the load sharing of processing works but also attains the data efficiency among the edges at the same time, which in turn improves the performance of the image processing and reduce the cost of the data transmission as well. RS-pCloud is designed to be used in a transparent way where it receives a query task from the user through a certain cloud platform, split the task into different sub-tasks, according to the location of the data they required, and then distribute the sub-tasks to corresponding clouds for near-data processing, the returned results from each cloud are first cached in specific edge for further sharing and then gathered at the client to synthesize the final product. We implemented and deployed RS-pCloud on three clusters in conjunction with an edge network to show its performance advantages over traditional single-cluster systems.","","978-1-7281-8254-4","10.1109/EDGE50951.2020.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284310","remote sensing image;edge-cloud architecture;Peer-to-Peer;near-data computing;load sharing","Performance evaluation;Data centers;Image edge detection;Image processing;Peer-to-peer computing;Task analysis;Remote sensing","","1","","25","IEEE","17 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, how to ensure the high reliability and availability of services needs to be solved. In this paper, we propose a service continuity management method that considers vehicle behavior, energy consumption, and application redirection in the fifth generation (5G) mobile networks. Firstly, we predict vehicle destination by adopting extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to decide where services are migrated following vehicle mobility. Secondly, we propose a MEC handover strategy based on markov decision process to reduce the overall energy consumption. Thirdly, we illustrate application redirection process in application domain based on 5G core network. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments using open source dataset and simulation data.

In contrast to deploying all computation to the cloud, the use of Distributed DNN (DDNN) often results in a reduced amount of data that is sent through the network and thus might increase the overall performance of the system. However, finding an appropriate deployment scenario is often a complex task and requires considering several criteria. In this paper, we introduce a multicriteria decision-making method based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process for the comparison and selection of deployment alternatives. We use the RECAP simulation framework to model and simulate DDNN deployments on different scales to provide a comprehensive assessment of deployments to system designers.

Such technologies are characterized by the integration of applications with different levels of criticality on shared platforms, which are referred to as mixed-criticality systems. Mixed-criticality systems typically use static scheduling for critical tasks; however, static scheduling is not suitable for scenarios where fog nodes run dynamic noncritical applications that implement, e.g., maintenance checks and data analytics. To address this challenge, in this paper, we differentiate between critical tasks that are statically allocated (called “native”) and dynamic non-critical tasks that may migrate across fog nodes (called “temporary”). We propose a static scheduling approach that maximizes the number of temporary tasks that can be added at runtime, without negatively impacting the already scheduled native tasks. This approach enables fog nodes to become more suitable for IIoT environments by configuring them with extensible schedules for the native tasks. To evaluate our approach, we perform experiments considering several test cases, which show that given a number of native tasks, the generated extensible schedules enable the fog nodes to run a larger number of temporary tasks at the same time. Furthermore, the extensible schedules exhibit 7.8 % less missed deadlines (on averaae), compared to the non-extensible schedules. To address this challenge, in this paper, we differentiate between critical tasks that are statically allocated (called “native”) and dynamic non-critical tasks that may migrate across fog nodes (called “temporary”). We propose a static scheduling approach that maximizes the number of temporary tasks that can be added at runtime, without negatively impacting the already scheduled native tasks.

Furthermore, the extensible schedules exhibit 7.8 % less missed deadlines (on averaae), compared to the non-extensible schedules.","","978-1-7281-8254-4","10.1109/EDGE50951.2020.00018","Horizon 2020(grant numbers:764785); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284242","Fog computing;mixed-criticality systems;scheduling;extensibility;optimization","Schedules;Job shop scheduling;Processor scheduling;Dynamic scheduling;Task analysis;Vehicle dynamics;Edge computing","","5","","39","IEEE","17 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a MEC enable multi-user wireless network is considered by offloading the computation task to MEC server, reducing latency and energy consumption of user terminal for Augmented Reality (AR) application. The joint optimization problem of resource allocation and task offloading is studied to minimize the energy consumption of each user subject to the delay requirement and the limited resources. We propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to solve this problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can greatly reduce energy consumption of the users.","","978-1-7281-8254-4","10.1109/EDGE50951.2020.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284282","Mobile Edge Computing;Deep Reinforcement Learning;Augmented Reality","Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Simulation;Reinforcement learning;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Resource management;Task analysis","","9","","19","IEEE","17 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, these schemes assume each server can only execute one task or job at any time. They do not consider lightweight tools that can wrap, isolate and co-locate multiple tasks in a virtualized server. As such, they can easily result in fragmentation and over-allocation of resources. Furthermore, as modern applications are becoming more complex, relatively few research considers the different characteristics of tasks, like the class, constraints and dependencies. This research aims to address these limitations, extend the state-of-the-art by providing an intelligent resource scheduling and optimization solutions for high performance in a federated edge computing system, considering both task dependencies and heterogeneous resource demands at the same time. Extensive simulations on real-world data-trace from the recent Alibaba cluster trace, with information on task dependencies and resource demands, show the effectiveness, faster executions, and resource efficiency of our approach.","","978-1-7281-8254-4","10.1109/EDGE50951.2020.00021","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61571401); University of Henan Province(grant numbers:18HASTIT021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284307","Edge computing;dependency-aware;application container;execution time;resource efficiency;co-location","Tools;Dispatching;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Servers;Task analysis;Optimization;Edge computing","","13","","35","IEEE","17 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
