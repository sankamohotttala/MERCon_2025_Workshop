The principal advantage of this class of methods is to better accommodate the real-world characteristics found in federated training, such as the lack of IID data across parties, the need for robustness to outliers or stragglers, and the requirement to perform well on party-specific datasets. We achieve this through a problem formulation that allows the central server to employ robust ways of aggregating the local models while keeping the structure of local computation intact. Without making any statistical assumption on the degree of heterogeneity of local data across parties, we provide convergence guarantees for Fed+ for convex and non-convex loss functions under different (robust) aggregation methods. The Fed+ theory is also equipped to handle heterogeneous computing environments including stragglers without additional assumptions; specifically, the convergence results cover the general setting where the number of local update steps across parties can vary. We demonstrate the benefits of Fed+ through extensive experiments across standard benchmark datasets.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-8140-3","10.1109/EDGE55608.2022.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860349","Federated Learning;Personalization;Robustness","Training;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Collaborative work;Robustness;Heterogeneous networks;Servers","","4","","26","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

FL, however, is susceptible to data heterogeneity problems as the FL clients have diverse data sources. Prior works employ auto-weighted model aggregation to mitigate the heterogeneity issue to minimize the impact of unfavorable model updates. However, existing approaches require extensive computation for statistical analysis of clients’ model updates. To circumvent this, we propose, FedASL (Federated Learning with Auto-weighted Aggregation based on Standard Deviation of Training Loss) which uses only the local training loss of FL clients for auto-weighting the model aggregation. Our evaluation under three different datasets and various data corruption scenarios reveals that FedASL can effectively thwart data corruption from bad clients while causing as little as one-tenth of the computation cost of existing approaches.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-8140-3","10.1109/EDGE55608.2022.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860312","federated learning;model aggregation;data heterogeneity;computational efficiency","Training;Costs;Statistical analysis;Computational modeling;Soft sensors;Machine learning;Collaborative work","","4","","29","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leaves the whole system not scalable and inefficient in energy consumption. In this paper, we propose an approach where edge intelligence is imposed in a clustered and cohesive manner.

This challenge is specifically exacerbated by the need to develop precise models that inherently consider the domain knowledge about the underlying physical structure, and the causal interdependencies between the various components of IoT systems. In this paper, we present an approach that is capable of leading to improved modeling and monitoring at the edges. To this end, we consider an IoT system as a network that can be represented by a graph. Then, we develop an approach that combines a semantic knowledge graph with a Transformer-based neural networks, under a Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN). Our GCNN produces features that are subsequently used with the Transformer to learn the parameters of an IoT model. We exploit the parameters of the model for monitoring and anomaly detection.

This paper aims to study numerous production-ready IoT offerings, extract recurring proven solution principles, and classify them into spatial patterns. The method of refinement of the goals is employed so that complex challenges can be solved by breaking them down into achievable and straightforward sub-goals. The present work deals with the major sub-goals, e.g. efficient coverage of the field, connectivity of the IoT devices, spatio-temporal aggregation of the data, and estimation of spatially connected regions of event detection. We have proposed methods to achieve each sub-goal for all different types of spatial patterns.

However, the growth of IoT data and devices at the edge of smart applications challenges the efficiency and time-sensitivity of the two-tier approach. Hence, it is critical to comprehend the significance of integrating a middle tier between the cloud and edge tiers, known as the fog tier. The fog tier’s main purpose is to decentralize the IoT workload to reduce latency and increase efficiency. This paper provides a review and presents a 3-Tier, 3-Dimensions reference model for smart spaces. The 3-tier represent the edge, fog, and cloud tiers, where each tier is coupled with the 3-dimensions that include computing, network, and application. Each dimension within each tier is presented along with the existing technologies that deliver on each dimension.

Inclusion of users’ devices increases the computing capability at the edge (adding to the infrastructure servers), but in comparison to the conventional edge ecosystems, it also introduces new challenges, such as service orchestration (i.e., service placement, discovery, and migration). We propose uDiscover, a novel user-driven service discovery and utilization framework for the PEC ecosystem.

We propose proactive and reactive service discovery approaches and assess their performance in PEC and infrastructure-only ecosystems.

As security is a crucial requirement for pervasive environment, we propose a middleware architecture easing the secure use of edge devices for pervasive applications, while supporting the heterogeneity of communication protocols and the dynamism of devices. Because of the heterogeneity in protocols and security features, not all edge devices are equally secure. To allow the pervasive applications to gain control over this heterogeneous security, we propose a model to describe edge devices security.

At the same time, serverless computing receives increasing attention as a new application deployment model because of its simplicity, scalability, event-driven processing, and short-lived computation. Therefore, there is a growing demand for applying serverless computing to edge computing environments. However, due to the lack of characterization of serverless edge computing (e.g., application performance and impact from resource heterogeneity), researchers and practitioners have to conduct tedious measurements to understand the performance of serverless applications on edge devices in non-systematic ways.We create EdgeFaaSBench, a novel benchmark suite for serverless computing on edge devices, to bridge this gap. EdgeFaaSBench is developed on top of Apache OpenFaaS with Docker Swarm and can run various serverless benchmark workloads on edge devices with different hardware specifications (e.g., GPUs). EdgeFaaSBench contains 14 different benchmark workloads running on heterogeneous edge devices and captures various system-level, application-level, and serverless-specific metrics, including system utilization, response time, cold/warm start times, and impact of concurrent function executions. Experimental studies are conducted on two widely used edge devices, Raspberry Pi 4B and Jetson Nano, to show EdgeFaaSBench’s capabilities to benchmark serverless computing on edge devices.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-8140-3","10.1109/EDGE55608.2022.00024","U.S. Department of Agriculture; Academy of Finland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860334","Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation;Edge Computing;Serverless Computing","Performance evaluation;Sentiment analysis;Scalability;Serverless computing;Object detection;Benchmark testing;Real-time systems","","7","","65","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While these gadgets provide enormous convenience, they generate a large amount of data that has already beyond the network’s capacity. To make matters worse, the data acquired by sensors on such IoT devices also include sensitive user data that must be appropriately treated. At the moment, the answer is to provide hub services for data storage in data centers. However, when data is housed in a centralized data center, data owners lose control of the data, since data centers are centralized solutions that rely on data owners’ faith in the service provider. In addition, edge computing enables edge devices to collect, analyze, and act closer to the data source, the challenge of data privacy near the edge is also a tough nut to crack.A large number of user information leakage both for IoT hub and edge made the system untrusted all along. Accordingly, building a decentralized IoT system near the edge and bringing real trust to the edge is indispensable and significant. To eliminate the need for a centralized data hub, we present a prototype of a unique, secure, and decentralized IoT framework called Reja, which is built on a permissioned Blockchain and an intrusion-tolerant messaging system ChiosEdge, and the critical components of ChiosEdge are reliable broadcast and BFT consensus.

Privacy disclosure is a major threat in IoT-related applications if collected data is directly outsourced. In IoT environments with large datasets, the existing Privacy-Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) mechanisms are inefficient and not scalable. To deal with this shortcoming, we develop a novel evolutionary PPDM framework, namely GPU-Enabled PPDM for IoT (GEPI), using GPUs at the edge layer to make the PPDM both efficient and exhibiting usefulness for IoT applications. On the one hand, the evolutionary algorithm used in the PPDM can guarantee the high utility by selecting the best candidate transactions for modification, providing a shareable dataset with minimum modifications and maximum privacy. On the other hand, the evolutionary algorithm is parallelized using a developed GPU based mechanism to accelerate database scans. In our mechanism, the dataset is distributed among the GPU threads to compute the fitness value in a parallel manner. Tests with extensive benchmarks reveal that our mechanism can accelerate the fitness function step 53.7x on average. The findings also show that the developed PPDM algorithm achieves an average speedup of 43.8x and 47.3x when compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms of ABC4ARH and PACO2DT, respectively.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-8140-3","10.1109/EDGE55608.2022.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860311","Internet of Things (IoT);Information privacy;Edge computing;Differential evolution;Big data;GPU platform","Data privacy;Scalability;Graphics processing units;Evolutionary computation;Computer architecture;Real-time systems;Internet of Things","","1","","37","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To complete the delivery tasks, UAVs usually need to store or have access to some sensitive data such as the private information about the parcel and its receiver during their flight, and only the authenticated people or devices are authorised to access the UAV's data. However, there are many potential risks such as injection attacks and spoofing attacks that can cause data leakage. Therefore, how to preserve users' sensitive data and authenticate the identities of people and devices in the UAV delivery system has become an essential requirement under the emerging zero-trust security framework. In this paper, to address such an issue, we propose a continuous authentication scheme for UAV delivery systems that is featured with continuous authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and digital authentication using the blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) technique. Specifically, continuous authentication is applied to both users and UAVs in the system. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed continuous authentication scheme can effectively prevent various attacks and provide security analysis for UAV delivery systems.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-8140-3","10.1109/EDGE55608.2022.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860313","UAV;Blockchain;Continuous authentication;Zero trust security;Edge computing","Multi-factor authentication;Authentication;Receivers;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Security;Task analysis;Logistics","","9","","31","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

VPA's capabilities are commonly called ""skills"". VPA can use skills to get users intent and provide corresponding services such as playing music. However, the skills supported by existing VPAs have many shortcomings. First of all, skills cannot support complex interactions between users and VPAs. The interaction process is often just a simple process. Secondly, many skills are unreliable because they frequently terminate execution when they receive unexpected input. Moreover, the services supported by current skills are very limited that cannot meet the diverse needs of users. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel skill model named CRSModel to support complex and reliable interactions between users, VPA and external services. In order to improve the complexity of interactions between users and VPA, CRSModel adds many configurations that are helpful to support complex interactions, and appends the dialogue flow processing mechanism to the execution process that can let users change the dialog flow. In terms of reliability, CRSModel's execution process can capture unexpected input and guide the user to input an expected value. Finally, in order to meet the diverse needs of users, CRSModel can support external services that satisfy the REST protocol, greatly increasing the variety of services.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-8140-3","10.1109/EDGE55608.2022.00028","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860291","Virtual Personal Assistant (VPA);Mobile and Edge Computing;Skill Model;External Service Interaction","Protocols;Annotations;Computational modeling;Manuals;Complexity theory;Reliability;Artificial intelligence","","","","17","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the failure of a single node may result in cascading failures that will adversely impact the delivery of the service and will result in failure to meet specific objectives. The impact of these failures needs to be minimised at runtime. Three techniques are explored in this paper, namely repartitioning, early-exit and skip-connection. When an edge node fails, the repartitioning technique will repartition and redeploy the DNN thus avoiding the failed nodes. The early-exit technique makes provision for a request to exit (early) before the failed node. The skip connection technique dynamically routes the request by skipping the failed nodes. This paper will leverage trade-offs in accuracy, end-to-end latency and downtime for selecting the best technique given user-defined objectives (accuracy, latency and downtime thresholds) when an edge node fails. To this end, CONTINUER is developed. Two key activities of the framework are estimating the accuracy and latency when using the techniques for distributed DNNs and selecting the best technique. It is demonstrated on a lab-based experimental testbed that CONTINUER estimates accuracy and latency when using the techniques with no more than an average error of 0.28% and 13.06%, respectively, and selects the suitable technique with a low overhead of no more than 16.82 milliseconds and an accuracy of up to 99.86%.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-8140-3","10.1109/EDGE55608.2022.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860277","Distributed DNNs;Edge computing;Failures","Deep learning;Runtime;Power system protection;Neural networks;Estimation;Power system faults;Edge computing","","1","","32","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The challenges are aggravated when both edge and fog devices get in the picture, since the limited resources of some of them exacerbate any possible issue, and create the need for a robust mechanism to collect log data to make sense of the system's behavior. The envisioned monitoring layer should collect log data regarding performance and errors, protect the data until they are delivered to an external data processing facility, and be easy to integrate into the deployed system. This paper proposes C-Mon, a resilience-focused monitoring framework for service-oriented applications that tests timing constraints against live log data. The monitoring framework is integrated with OpenAPI Generator, the mainstream ReST code generator we used to generate client and server interfaces and monitoring mechanisms. Log data are cached locally on the disk of the fog/edge devices and transferred to the monitoring server only when enough CPU cycles and network bandwidth are available, at the same time enabling forensics analysis.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-8140-3","10.1109/EDGE55608.2022.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860331","Fog devices;caching;IoT;network monitoring;API generation","Performance evaluation;Forensics;Data processing;Generators;Computer crashes;Timing;Servers","","2","","27","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There has been an increasing adoption of UAV-mounted mobile cloudlets to address these issues, where mobile cloudlets can be seamlessly integrated into the existing network infrastructure for offloading and enhanced connectivity. However, adaptively placing mobile cloudlets under continuously evolving conditions is still an open problem. In this paper, we study mobile cloudlet placement in highly dynamic, next-generation edge networks. Our objective is to maintain stable ultra-low-latency services and enhance coverage by optimizing the placement of mobile cloudlets in highly dynamic scenarios. We propose a novel approach for this problem using inspirations from concepts in physics, namely the center of gravity and force of attraction. Our approach emulates how physical bodies maintain balance and adjust their positions when acted upon by dynamic external forces for efficient placement of mobile cloudlets in response to dynamic and uncertain device mobility.

Due to the sudden breakdown of the sensor nodes or saving energy by deliberately shutting down partial sensors, there are always massive missing entries in the collected sensing data from WSNs. Low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA) is a typical and effective approach to achieving data recovery for WSNs. However, existing LRMA-based approaches ignore the adverse effects of noises inevitably mixed with collected data, which may dramatically degrade their recovery accuracy. In this paper, we aim at recovering missing data based on partially observed data mixed with noises in WSNs. To this end, we propose a latent factor analysis (LFA) based spatio-temporal signal recovery (STSR) model, named LFA-STSR. Its main idea is to incorporate the spatio-temporal correlation into a robust LFA model as the regularization constraint, making it possess the merits of both high accuracy and robustness during data recovery. To evaluate the proposed LFA-STSR model, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world WSNs datasets. The results demonstrate that LFASTSR has significantly higher recovery accuracy than the related state-of-the-art models.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-8140-3","10.1109/EDGE55608.2022.00033","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9859569","Wireless sensor networks;latent factor analysis;spatio-temporal correlation;low-rank matrix approximation","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Analytical models;Correlation;Electric breakdown;Data models;Robustness","","4","","48","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, mobile devices still face critical challenges, such as restricted power, sensitive latency, limited memory. As emerging AI chips are integrated into mobile devices, mobile AI solutions are proposed to accelerate model execution and improve mobile service experience. Unfortunately, they only focus on the acceleration of single chip and ignore the heterogeneity among different chips. This paper proposes a mobile heterogeneous computing AI middleware, which provides developers of AI applications with the ability to accelerate model execution. This proposed middleware utilizes three heterogeneous chips, CPU, GPU, DSP for model scheduling at a layer-wise granularity. It is designed in five layers from top to bottom: User Interface Layer, Heterogeneous Scheduling Layer, Performance Collection Layer, Hardware Information Collection Layer, AI Framework Layer. We verified it in the environment of typical mobile device through a series of experiments. The results prove the high accuracy of data collection algorithm and the effectiveness of heterogeneous scheduling services.

It is used for online monitoring as well as long term data analytics, enabling countless use cases from damage prevention to predictive maintenance. Multivariate sensor time series data is acquired and initially stored close to the sensor, at the edge. It is also beneficial to summarize this data in windowed aggregations at different resolutions. A subset of the resulting aggregation hierarchy is typically sent to a cloud infrastructure, often via intermittent or low bandwidth connections. Consequently, different views on the data exist on different nodes in the edge-to-cloud continuum. However, when querying this data, users are interested in a fast response and a complete, unified view on the data, regardless of which part in the infrastructure continuum they send the query to and where the data is physically stored. In this paper, we present a loosely coupled approach that enables fast range queries on a distributed and hierarchical sensor database. Our system only assumes the possibility of fast local range queries on a hierarchical sensor database. It does not require any shared state between nodes and thus degrades gracefully in case certain parts of the hierarchy are unreachable. We show that our system is suitable for driving interactive data exploration sessions on terabytes of data while unifying the different views on the data. Thus, our system can improve the data analysis experience in many geo-distributed scenarios.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-8140-3","10.1109/EDGE55608.2022.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860303","edge;cloud;multivariate sensor data stream;distributed query","Cloud computing;Data analysis;Time series analysis;Distributed databases;Memory;Bandwidth;Data communication","","1","","15","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
