Considering the dynamic nature of the edge environment, for ensuring decision accuracy, edge devices always need to collect the latest samples and upload them to the cloud to get an updated model. During this process, it is crucial to determine which samples are necessary to be uploaded considering the communication cost. We propose a scenario adaptive edge data reduction strategy to filter samples differently from existing approaches by measuring whether they can affect current decision accuracy. First, we put forward a novel adaptive data reduction framework for cloud-edge collaborative scenarios. Then, we present the implementation algorithms for filtering samples based on scenarios, identifying candidate scenarios emerging in edge environments, and updating edge scenarios.

Traditional environmental monitoring is often based on fixed sensors with limited server racks to collect temperature and humidity data, which cannot be effectively combined with the server task scheduling and resource allocation system. In order to provide reliable services to users, a reliable and low-power data center environmental data monitoring system is needed to collect and analyze data such as temperature, humidity and smoke. This paper presents a data center monitoring system based on edge computing, which uses edge computing and wireless sensor network technology to monitor the running status of the data center. The edge device collects the environmental data in real time, and then obtains the real-time running state parameters of the server through Intelligent Platform Management Interface.

This paper presents an improvement of an existing algorithm Score-Based Match-Making (SBMM) to solve the aforementioned challenge. A six-factors score-based Match-Making algorithm is proposed to tackle priority-related challenges in resource allocation with a preemption factor to deal with emergency problems. An evaluation of our own orchestration platform (Edge Diagnostics Platform) under different scenarios and algorithms, namely random, naive, SBMM is presented. The experimental studies highlight the improvement in clients' priority distribution in edge servers and solve the problem of emergency clients with preemption.

Data-dependent tasks that analyze locally-acquired sensing data are one of the most common candidates for task offloading in edge computing. As a result, the total latency and network load are affected by the total amount of data transferred from end-user devices to the selected edge servers. Most existing solutions for task allocation in edge computing do not take into consideration that some user tasks may actually operate on the same data items. Making the task allocation algorithm aware of the existing data sharing characteristics of tasks can help reduce network load at a negligible profit loss by allocating more tasks sharing data on the same server. In this paper, we formulate the data sharing-aware task allocation problem that make decisions on task allocation for maximized profit and minimized network load by taking into account the data-sharing characteristics of tasks. In addition, because the problem is NP-hard, we design the DSTA algorithm, which finds a solution to the problem in polynomial time. We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm against a state-of-the-art baseline that only maximizes profit. Our extensive analysis shows that DSTA leads to about 8 times lower data load on the network while being within 1.03 times of the total profit on average compared to the state-of-the-art.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-0062-6","10.1109/EDGE53862.2021.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9712158","Edge Computing;Data sharing;Task Allocation;Profit Maximization;Network Load Minimization","Greedy algorithms;Energy consumption;Conferences;Telecommunication traffic;Minimization;Sensors;Servers","","7","","23","IEEE","17 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work proposes a novel model named the distributed k-server problem that formulates the MES resource scheduling to address the heterogeneity issues in both servers and requests. We design an algorithm named DWFA based on the efficient network flow-based Work Function Algorithm (WFA) to the classic k-server problem as an immediate solution to the proposed problem. DWFA inher-its the competitiveness of WFA but has high computational complexity. To further increase scalability via the computing power of MES, we parallelise DWFA to design a distributed algorithm named FD-WFA as a distributed execution of DWFA, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and increases the practicality.

"A Framework for Analyzing Resource Allocation Policies for Multi-Access Edge Computing","K. Ray; A. Banerjee","Advanced Computing and Microelectronics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute; Advanced Computing and Microelectronics Unit, Indian Statistical Institute",2021 IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE),"17 Feb 2022","2021","","","102","110","Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising new paradigm enabling low-latency access to services deployed on edge servers. This helps to avert network latencies often encountered in accessing cloud services. The cornerstone of a MEC environment is a resource allocation policy used to partition and allocate computational resources such as bandwidth, memory available on the edge server to user service invocations availing such services. In this work, we propose a generic data-driven framework to model and analyze such MEC resource allocation policies. We model a MEC system as a Turn-Based Stochastic Multi-Player Game and use Probabilistic Model Checking to derive quantitative guarantees on resource allocation policies against requirements expressed in Probabilistic Alternating-Time Temporal Logic with Rewards. We present results on state-of-the-art MEC resource allocation policies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-0062-6","10.1109/EDGE53862.2021.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9712000","Multi-Access Edge Computing;Resource Allo-cation;Probabilistic Model Checking;Verification","Analytical models;Multi-access edge computing;Computational modeling;Stochastic processes;Games;Model checking;Probabilistic logic","","4","","29","IEEE","17 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the edge server has small storage capacity, irregular user requests and real-time changes in user preferences. To address these problems, this paper presents a Mobile Edge Data Cooperative Cache Admission Based on Content Popularity (DCCCP) based on the perspective of the content provider. First, we analyze and learn the key feature properties of video objects to build the tree data structure and dynamically adjust the tree structure according to the state of the leaf nodes. Next, the multiarm bandit model is considered for the tree structure characteristics and the number of samples. In addition, considering the limited edge server capacity and the large cloudedge transmission latency, edge collaboration is used for data cache. Finally, we experiment the DCCCP algorithm with four excellent algorithms in terms of hit rate, latency and system cost, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCCCP algorithm.","2767-9918","978-1-6654-0062-6","10.1109/EDGE53862.2021.00024","Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4192007); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61202076); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9712069","Edge Caching;Content Popularity;Cache Admission;Edge Collaboration;Video Features;Video Content Delivery","Tree data structures;Costs;System performance;Computational modeling;Data security;Streaming media;Data models","","1","","18","IEEE","17 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
