Wearing protective equipment has become the primary recommendation for safe riding. However, passive protection cannot prevent the occurrence of accidents. Thus, timely predicting the rider's maneuver is essential for active protection and providing more time to avoid potential accidents from happening. Through the qualitative study, we argue that we can use the rider's head dynamic as an information source to predict the rider's following maneuvers. We accordingly present HeadMon, a riding maneuver prediction system for safe riding. HeadMon utilizes the head dynamics of a rider by installing an inertial measurement unit on the helmet. It uses the extracted head dynamics features as the input of the deep learning architecture to achieve prediction. We implemented the HeadMon prototype on Android smartphone as a proof of concept. Through comprehensive experiments with 20 participants, the result demonstrates the excellent performance of HeadMon: not only could it achieve an overall precision of at least 85% for maneuver prediction under a 4s prediction time gap, but it also could keep a high accuracy under a low sampling rate. The low-cost feature of HeadMon allows it to be readily deployable and towards more safety riding.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099215","Human Activity Prediction;Head Movement;Mobile Computing","Pervasive computing;Measurement units;Head;Urban areas;Deep architecture;Prototypes;Inertial navigation","","2","","28","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But existing works simply consider it as a singular activity recognition problem. This is not in line with practice since users may have different body movements such as walking and jogging along with head gestures. It is also beneficial to recognize body movements during human-device interaction since it provides useful context information. As a result, it is significant to recognize such composite activities in which actions of different body parts happen simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a system called CHAR to recognize composite head-body activities with a single IMU sensor. The key idea of our solution is to make use of the inter-correlation of different activities and design a multi-task learning network to extract shared and specific representations. We implement a real-time prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate it. The results show that CHAR can recognize 60 kinds of composite activities (12 head gestures and 5 body movements) with high accuracies of 97.0% and 89.7% in user- dependent and independent cases, respectively.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099218","China NSFC(grant numbers:62172286,61872247,U2001207); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099218","Composite activity recognition;Earable device;Multi-task learning","Pervasive computing;Performance evaluation;Legged locomotion;Headphones;Prototypes;Activity recognition;Multitasking","","2","","37","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"DroneVLC: Exploiting Drones and VLC to Gather Data from Batteryless Sensors","L. De Groot; T. Xu; M. Z. Zamalloa",Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology,2023 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom),"18 Apr 2023","2023","","","242","251","We explore a new alternative for drones to gather information from sensors. Instead of using the traditional radio-frequency spectrum, whose broadcast nature makes it more difficult to poll specific objects, we utilize the light spectrum. In our system, the drone carries a light, and flies to an area that it is interested in polling. Only the sensor (tag) under the coverage of the light sends data back by backscattering the impinging light waves. Enabling this system poses two challenges. First, a reliable modulation method with light is required. The method must overcome noise dynamics introduced by the drone (mechanical oscillations), the object (backscattering effects) and the environment (interference from ambient light). Second, to facilitate the deployment of tags in pervasive applications, the design of the tag should be battery-less and have a small surface area. These requirements limit the amount of power available for reception, transmission and sensing, since the energy harvested by solar cells is proportional to their surface area. Regarding the first challenge, we show that the amplitude-based modulation methods used in state-of-the-art studies do not work in our scenario, and investigate instead a frequency-based approach. For the second challenge, we optimize the computation, reception and transmission of the tag to create a battery-less design that operates with frequency-modulated signals generated from light. We build a prototype for the drone and the tag, and test them under different lighting scenarios: dark, indoors, and outdoors with sunlight. The results show that, under standard indoor lighting, our system can attain a polling range of 1.1 m with a data rate of 120 bps, while the tag operates with small solar cells and consumes less than 1 mW.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099247","Visible Light Communication;Backscatter;Bat-teryless;Drones;UAV;Dynamic Channel","Radio frequency;Frequency modulation;Photovoltaic cells;Lighting;Prototypes;Reliability;Standards","","3","","33","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To provide accurate and efficient real-time tracking, a tracking target's future movements need to be predicted. Particularly, the destination camera and travel time of the target object are to be identified so that tracking duties can be handover-ed seamlessly. In this paper, we propose a collaborative cross-camera tracking system, called PreActo, with two key features: (1) ResNet-based trajectory learning to exploit the rich spatio-temporal information embedded within objects' moving patterns, which has not been utilized by the existing literature, and (2) collaboration between the edge server and the edge device for real-time trajectory prediction and tracking handover. To prove the validity of our proposed system, we evaluate PreActo on a video dataset leveraging real-world trajectories. Evaluation results show that the proposed system reduces up to $7\times$ the number of processed frames for handover, with $2\times$ lower latency while providing $1.5\times$ tracking precision improvement compared to the state-of-the-art.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099298","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099298","Edge Computing;Machine Learning;Object Tracking;Trajectory learning","Target tracking;Visual analytics;Collaboration;Streaming media;Cameras;Real-time systems;Trajectory","","3","","41","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among them, device-free indoor localization does not require the target persons to possess a localization device, such as a smartphone, which can support the localization of all persons in the environment. Many methods using RSSI and Wi-Fi CSI have been proposed as device-free indoor localization using radio waves. However, RSSI is easily affected by environmental factors, such as multipath propagation. Wi-Fi CSI also has the disadvantage that there is no standard, so it relies on special hardware and software. Therefore, we propose device-free multi-person indoor localization using ToF information, which is less susceptible to noise. ToF information in indoor localization has mainly been used for highly accurate estimation of the receiver position, while this paper proposes a new application. In addition, distance measurements using ToF of Wi-Fi and UWB have been standardized and can be implemented with commercial equipment, which is highly practical. In this research, we considered the change in the distance measurement due to radio wave occlusion by a human body and built a device-free indoor localization system that can estimate multi-person position even if the model is trained on the data of only one person.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099384","Wi-Fi;UWB;Round Trip Time;Time of Flight;device-free indoor localization;indoor positioning;density estimation","Location awareness;Estimation;Training data;Receivers;Distance measurement;Data models;Transceivers","","1","","21","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

HR is a key physiological marker of cardiovascular health and physical fitness. Continuous and reliable HR monitoring with wearable devices has therefore gained increasing attention in recent years. Existing HR detection systems in wearables mainly rely on photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, however, these are notorious for poor performance in the presence of human motion. In this work, leveraging the occlusion effect that enhances low-frequency bone-conducted sounds in the ear canal, we investigate for the first time in-ear audio-based motion-resilient HR monitoring. We first collected HR-induced sounds in the ear canal leveraging an in-ear microphone under stationary and three different activities (i.e., walking, running, and speaking). Then, we devised a novel deep learning based motion artefact (MA) mitigation framework to denoise the in-ear audio signals, followed by an HR estimation algorithm to extract HR. With data collected from 20 subjects over four activities, we demonstrate that hEARt, our end-to-end approach, achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.02 $\pm\ \boldsymbol{ 2.97}$ BPM, 8.12 $\pm\ \boldsymbol{6.74}$ BPM, 11.23 $\pm\ \boldsymbol{9.20}$ BPM and 9.39 $\pm\ \boldsymbol{6.97}$ BPM for stationary, walking, running and speaking, respectively, opening the door to a new non-invasive and affordable HR monitoring with usable performance for daily activities.

Sound-based estimation of the movement properties of an obstacle has been actively studied in pervasive computing, and generally provides the distance from a smartphone user to an obstacle and the relative velocity of the obstacle. However, most prior studies have focused on estimating the properties of either static or mobile obstacles. Furthermore, they estimated either the distance to obstacles or their relative velocity. Nonetheless, both the distance and relative velocity of the oncoming obstacles are necessary to derive the timing of a possible collision. To address this issue, we proposed a new probing signal composed of sine waves and sine sweeps, designed to acquire information about both the distance and relative velocity of static and mobile obstacles. In addition, we proposed a neural network model that can jointly predict distance and relative velocity from reflected sounds of the probing signal captured by a smartphone. The proposed neural network was designed to consider the mobility status of obstacles, i.e., whether they are mobile or static, in order to select the most appropriate method to estimate their distance and relative velocity. In addition, our method uses the relationship between distance and velocity to increase the precision of its estimations. For example, the distance can be estimated by integrating the velocity-time curve. The performance of ObsSense was evaluated using real-world data, and the experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed probing signal and neural network architecture.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099353","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP21H03428,JP21H05299,JP21J10059); JST-Mirai Program(grant numbers:JP21473170); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099353","Active sound sensing;pedestrian safety;obstacles","Pervasive computing;Neural networks;Estimation;Computer architecture;Predictive models;Sensors;Safety","","","","37","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, despite one decade of active research on Wi-Fi sensing, most existing work only considers legacy IEEE 802.11n devices, often in particular and strictly-controlled environments. Worse yet, there is a fundamental lack of understanding of the impact on CSI-based sensing of modern Wi-Fi features, such as 160-MHz bandwidth, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions, and increased spectral resolution in IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6). This work aims to shed light on the impact of Wi-Fi 6 features on the sensing performance and to create a benchmark for future research on Wi-Fi sensing. To this end, we perform an extensive CSI data collection campaign involving 3 individuals, 3 environments, and 12 activities, using Wi-Fi 6 signals. An anonymized ground truth obtained through video recording accompanies our 80-GB dataset, which contains almost two hours of CSI data from three collectors. We leverage our dataset to dissect the performance of a state-of-the-art sensing framework across different environments and individuals. Our key findings suggest that (i) MIMO transmissions and higher spectral resolution might be more beneficial than larger bandwidth for sensing applications; (ii) there is a pressing need to standardize research on Wi-Fi sensing because the path towards a truly environment-independent framework is still uncertain. To ease the experiments' replicability and address the current lack of Wi-Fi 6 CSI datasets, we release our 80-GB dataset to the community.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099368","Device-free sensing;Channel State Information;Wi-Fi 6","Systematics;IEEE 802.11ax Standard;Bandwidth;Pressing;Sensors;Security;Wireless fidelity","","13","","39","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The batteries used in harvesting devices have inherently limited lifespans, and the device experiences a long cold-start time when charging the battery. In this paper, we propose a long-lasting and highly responsive batteryless system, called RENO, to solve the problems that occur in energy harvesting devices. Using a supercapacitor to store energy, RENO maximizes the responsiveness in ENO especially running in dynamic harvesting environments such as indoor light energy harvesting. Combining the intermittent characteristics of power-neutral operation (PNO), RENO allows dual-mode operation of PNO and ENO, depending on the current harvesting capability. The device works as a PNO device when charging the energy storage, solving the ENO cold-start issue, while the harvested energy is efficiently managed with ENO. For this dual-mode operation, RENO provides hardware and software that handle the switch between PNO and ENO effectively. Application developers are provided with a well-defined API, which enables energy-efficient development of applications without detailed knowledge of the target hardware. Using the API, developers simply declare a task to be executed as either PNO or ENO, and the rest is handled by the system. The prototype system is implemented, and its functionality is evaluated in controlled environments. We also validate the proposed system with two real-world applications, proving the efficacy of dual-mode batteryless operation.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099205","Batteryless systems;energy-harvesting","Pervasive computing;Prototypes;Switches;Supercapacitors;Programming;Hardware;Software","","","","26","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some methods share extra samples from the server to clients, which requires comprehensive data collection by the server and may raise potential privacy risks. In this work, we propose an efficient and adaptive framework, named Generative Federated Learning (GFL), to solve the skewed data problem in FL systems in a privacy-friendly way.

EMGSense addresses one of the fundamental challenges in EMG cross-user sensing—the significant performance degradation caused by time-varying biological heterogeneity—in a low-effort (data-efficient and label-free) manner. To alleviate the burden of data collection and avoid labor-intensive data annotation, we propose two EMG-specific data augmentation methods to simulate the EMG signals generated in various conditions and scope the exploration in label-free scenarios. We model combating biological heterogeneity-caused performance degradation as a multi-source domain adaptation problem that can learn from the diversity among source users to eliminate EMG heterogeneous biological features. To relearn the target-user-specific biological features from the unlabeled data, we integrate advanced self-supervised techniques into a carefully designed deep neural network (DNN) structure.

SEEK utilizes vehicle dashcam images to identify a vehicle's true location and detects possible GPS spoofing attacks through verifying if the reported GPS locations of the vehicle are correct. However, it is nontrivial to use dashcam images for vehicle localization due to multiple challenges caused by real-world driving, including the complicated lighting/weather conditions, season/timing variations of the images, large blockage ratio in the images, and varying driving speeds. SEEK features a unique design with novel schemes to address complicated lighting/weather conditions, transform images to align with season changes, reduce blockage, and adopt a sequential image matching scheme.

Examples of these applications include pedestrian tracking systems in large areas. Although the ubiquity of camera-based systems, they are not a preferable solution due to the vulnerability of leaking the privacy of pedestrians. In this paper, we introduce a novel privacy-preserving system for pedestrian tracking in smart environments using multiple distributed LiDARs of non-overlapping views. The system is designed to leverage LiDAR devices to track pedestrians in partially covered areas due to practical constraints, e.g., occlusion or cost. Therefore, the system uses the point cloud captured by different LiDARs to extract discriminative features that are used to train a metric learning model for pedestrian matching purposes. To boost the system's robustness, we leverage a probabilistic approach to model and adapt the dynamic mobility patterns of individuals and thus connect their sub-trajectories. We deployed the system in a large-scale testbed with 70 colorless LiDARs and conducted three different experiments. The evaluation result at the entrance hall confirms the system's ability to accurately track the pedestrians with a 0.98 F-measure even with zero-covered areas. This result highlights the promise of the proposed system as the next generation of privacy-preserving tracking means in smart environments.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099061","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JPMXP0518071489,22K12011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099061","Point cloud-based recognition;LiDAR;Privacy-preserving;Re-ID;Pedestrian tracking","Point cloud compression;Pervasive computing;Adaptation models;Privacy;Laser radar;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction","","16","","48","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we propose enhancements to CPC, by systematically investigating the encoder architecture, the aggregator network, and the future timestep prediction, resulting in a fully con-volutional architecture. Across sensor positions and activities, our method shows substantial improvements on four of six target datasets, demonstrating its ability to empower a wide range of application scenarios.

For HAR, multi-sensor channel information is vital to performance. Current work states that applying an attention neural network to prioritize discriminatory sensor channels helps the model classify activity more precisely. However, getting discriminatory information from multisensory channels is not always trivial. For example, when collecting data from elderly hospitalized patients. In this context, existing HAR methods struggle to classify activities, particularly activities with similar natures. Moreover, HAR deep models predominantly suffer from overfitting due to small datasets, which leads to poor performance. Data augmentation is a viable solution to this problem. However, currently available data augmentation methods to HAR have various drawbacks, including the pos-sibility of being domain-dependent, and resulting in distorted models for test sequences. To address the aforementioned HAR problems, we propose a novel framework that primarily focuses on two aspects. First, enhancing the latent information across each sensor channel and learning to exploit the relation among multiple latent features and the ongoing activity. Consequently, this enriches the discriminatory feature representations of each activity. Second, a new augmentation strategy is introduced to address the shortcomings of existing multi-sensor channel data augmentation to generalize our HAR model. Our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on the four most commonly used HAR datasets from diverse domains. We exten-sively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through detailed quantitative analysis of experimental results and ablation studies.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099138","ubiquitous computing;activity recognition;deep learning;attention;wearable sensors;data augmentation","Statistical analysis;Neural networks;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Benchmark testing;Ubiquitous computing;Data models;Sensors","","3","","29","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The pressure mapping mattress is a non-invasive and privacy-preserving tool to obtain the pressure distribution image over the bed surface, which strongly correlates with the body weight of the lying person. To extract the body weight from this image, we propose a deep learning-based model, including a dual-branch network to extract the deep features and pose features respectively. A contrastive learning module is also combined to the deep-feature branch to help mine the mutual factors across different postures of every single subject. The two groups of features are then concatenated for the body weight regression task. To test the model's performance over different hardware and posture settings, we create a pressure image dataset of 10 subjects and 23 postures, using a self-made pressure-sensing bedsheet.

In real-world applications, the RSS modality is inherently well-known for its extreme sensitivity to dynamic environments. Since most machine learning algorithms applied to the RSS modality do not possess any attention mechanism, they can only capture superficial representations, yet subtle but distinct ones characterizing specific locations, thereby leading to significant degradation in the testing phase. In contrast, AaTs are enabled to focus exclusively on relevant anchors at every Received Signal Strength (RSS) sequence for these subtle but distinct representations. This also facilitates the model to neglect redundant clues formed by noisy ambient conditions, thus achieving better accuracy in fingerprinting localization. Moreover, explicitly resolving collapse problems at the feature level (i.e., none-informative or homogeneous features) can further invigorate the self-attention process, by which subtle but distinct representations to specific locations are radically captured with ease. To this end, we enhance our proposed model with two sub-constraints, namely covariance and variance losses that are mediated with the main task within the representation learning stage towards a novel multi-task learning manner. To evaluate our AaTs, we compare the models with the state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on three benchmark indoor localization datasets.

ZoneFL divides the physical space into geographical zones mapped to a mobile-edge-cloud system architecture for good model accuracy and scalability. Each zone has a federated training model, called a zone model, which adapts well to data and behaviors of users in that zone. Benefiting from the FL design, the user data privacy is protected during the ZoneFL training. We propose two novel zone-based federated training algorithms to optimize zone models to user mobility behavior: Zone Merge and Split (ZMS) and Zone Gradient Diffusion (ZGD). ZMS optimizes zone models by adapting the zone geographical partitions through merging of neighboring zones or splitting of large zones into smaller ones. Different from ZMS, ZGD maintains fixed zones and optimizes a zone model by incorporating the gradients derived from neighboring zones' data. ZGD uses a self-attention mechanism to dynamically control the impact of one zone on its neighbors. Extensive analysis and experimental results demonstrate that ZoneFL significantly outperforms traditional FL in two models for heart rate prediction and human activity recognition.

However, enjoying both the reduced latency of Edge and the scalability of FaaS requires new architectures and implementations to cope with typical Edge challenges (e.g., nodes with limited computational capacity). While first solutions have been proposed for Edge-based FaaS, including light function sandboxing techniques, we lack a platform with the ability to span both Edge and Cloud and adaptively exploit both. In this paper, we present Serverledge, a FaaS platform designed for the Edge-to-Cloud continuum. Serverledge adopts a decentralized architecture, where function invocation requests can be fully served within Edge nodes. To cope with load peaks, Serverledge also supports vertical (i.e., from Edge to Cloud) and horizontal (i.e., among Edge nodes) computation offloading. Our evaluation shows that Serverledge outperforms Apache OpenWhisk in an Edge-like scenario and has competitive performance with state-of-the-art frameworks optimized for the Edge, with the advantage of built-in support for vertical and horizontal offloading.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099372","Italian National Research Centre in High Performance Computing, Big Data and Quantum Computing (ICSC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099372","serverless;edge computing;offloading","Pervasive computing;Scalability;Decentralized control;Computer architecture","","17","","26","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Scheduled Spatial Sensing against Adversarial WiFi Sensing","S. M. Hernandez; E.

It uses machine learning classification models to predict physical actions being performed in a given environment (e.g., human activities such as walking, running). Thanks to the existing WiFi infrastructure in most indoor areas, this device-free technology can be used to provide low-cost motion detection and activity recognition opportunities for smart-homes. However, as the WiFi signals can be sniffed by adversaries, it can also be utilized by malicious actors to learn private information about the residents. To address this issue, motivated by the fact that the accuracy of WiFi sensing systems is highly reliant on the location of transmitter and receiver devices, we propose a simple yet effective solution based on the utilization of spatially distributed transmitter antennas (connected to a single source device) which communicate to a receiver device. The legitimate or allowed receiver is provided the schedule of transmitter antennas; thus, it can leverage this information to more accurately recognize activities performed within the environment. On the other hand, an eavesdropper who is unaware of the transmission schedule will encode the CSI frames from all transmitter antennas as if they were transmitted by a single source and thus will fail to recognize the activities properly. Through experiments, we show the effectiveness of this approach considering different number of transmitter antennas as well as against different levels of eavesdroppers.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-5378-3","10.1109/PERCOM56429.2023.10099079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099079","WiFi sensing;security and privacy;human activity detection","Performance evaluation;Schedules;Transmitting antennas;Receiving antennas;Predictive models;Data models;Reflection","","","","40","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These ever-expanding AI capabilities open exciting avenues for advances in new domains. I will discuss our AI research for advancing scientific discovery for a sustainable future. In particular, I will talk about our research in a new interdisciplinary field, Computational Sustainability, which aims to develop computational models and methods to help balance the environmental, economic, and societal needs for a sustainable future. I will provide examples of computational sustainability problems, ranging from biodiversity conservation to multi-criteria strategic planning of hydropower dams in the Amazon basin and materials discovery for renewable energy materials. I will also highlight our work on AI to accelerate the discovery of new solar fuels materials. In this work, we propose an approach called Deep Reasoning Networks (DRNets), which requires only modest amounts of (unlabeled) data, in sharp contrast to standard deep learning approaches. DRNets reach superhuman performance for crystal-structure phase mapping, a core, long-standing challenge in materials science, enabling the discovery of solar-fuels materials. DRNets provide a general framework for integrating deep learning and reasoning for tackling challenging problems.
