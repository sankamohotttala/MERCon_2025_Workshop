"Universal Space-Time Stream Backscatter with Ambient WiFi","Y. Yang; W.

Existing space-time stream backscatter systems are non-universal and inefficient due to aspects like tag-data modulation being heavily related to the ambient excitation’s stream number, low throughput with multi-stream excitation, and the need for the original signal for tag-data demodulation.We introduce STScatter, a universal space-time stream backscatter. STScatter includes the following unique features that set it apart from other systems: For starters, STScatter’s tag-data modulation is universal for excitation with any number of space-time streams. Furthermore, STScatter achieves efficient tag-data modulation at the symbol-level, allowing space-time stream backscatter to reach high tag-data throughput. Additionally, unlike previous systems that decoded tag data from both the original ambient and backscattered signal, STScatter can decode ambient data and backscatter data simultaneously from the backscattered signal.STScatter is prototyped using commercial FPGAs and SDRs. Our extensive experiments show that the STScatter is universal with different space-time streams excitation, including WiFi 4/5. STScatter can achieve a throughput of up to 499.95 kbps in single-stream excitation and 499.94 kbps in multi-stream excitation, which is 4.10x and 171.10x better than MOXcatter.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-1643-6","10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762393","Internet of Things;backscatter;WiFi","Pervasive computing;Conferences;Throughput;Internet of Things;Wireless fidelity;Field programmable gate arrays;Backscatter","","16","","47","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recognition of packaging tasks using standard supervised machine learning is difficult because the observed data vary considerably depending on the number of items to pack, the size of the items, and other parameters. In this study, we focus on characteristic and necessary actions (motions) that occur in a specific operation such as an action of stretching packing tape when assembling shipping boxes. We propose the use of an attention-based neural network to focus on these characteristic actions when recognizing the data. However, training of a such deep network model is a data-intensive process, and obtaining a huge amount of labeled training data in actual industrial settings is difficult. To address this problem, we employ motif-detection algorithms to detect sensor data motifs (segments corresponding to characteristic actions) that can be useful for recognizing operations in advance. Moreover, we propose that the training of the attention-based network should be guided such that it pays attention to the detected motifs, i.e., motif-guided training.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-1643-6","10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762388","Activity recognition;Machine learning;Logistics;Packaging task","Training;Pervasive computing;Neural networks;Training data;Machine learning;Packaging;Activity recognition","","10","","39","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These strategies are not ideal for early impairment detection as the individual needs to be present physically at the clinic to avail the assessments, especially for older adults who require assistance from a caregiver, and experience mobility, cognitive and functional disabilities from neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, these strategies rely on self-reporting and proxy reports for evaluation which often leads to under-reporting of symptoms and decrease the validity of these measures. We argue that an early assessment of functional, and cognitive health impairment can be obtained from the individual’s daily activities captured through accelerometry. In this work, we postulate to learn high-level motion related representations from accelerometer data to better correlate with underlying functional and cognitive health parameters of older adults using a contrastive and multi-task learning framework. In particular, we posit a novel indicator, Impairment Indicator using the proposed multi-task learning framework that can indicate functional or cognitive decline as neurodegenerative disease progresses. An extensive 24-hour data collection from 25 older adults with the clinician in-the-loop was carried out in a retirement community center with IRB approval. We collected the activity patterns using wearables in their homes in addition to survey-based assessments and observational performance measures recorded by a clinical evaluator to infer their current cognitive and functional impairment status. Our evaluation on the acquired dataset reveals that the representations learned using contrastive learning aids in improving the detection of activities, activity performance score, and stage of dementia to 92%, 97%, and 98%, respectively.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-1643-6","10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762401","Multi-task learning;Contrastive Learning;Activity Recognition;Functional;Cognitive Impairment Assessment","Accelerometers;Wearable computers;Current measurement;Conferences;Data collection;Activity recognition;Multitasking","","5","","43","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One common approach to reducing such energy overheads is the capture and transmission of lower-resolution images to an edge node (where the DNN inferencing task is executed), but this results in an accuracy-vs-energy tradeoff, as the DNN inference accuracy typically degrades with a drop in resolution. In this work, we introduce MRIM, a simple but effective framework to tackle this tradeoff. Under MRIM, the vision sensor platform first executes a lightweight preprocessing step to determine the saliency of different sub-regions within a single captured image frame, and then performs a saliency-aware non-uniform downscaling of individual sub-regions to produce a “mixed-resolution” image. We describe two novel low-complexity algorithms that the sensor platform can use to quickly compute suitable resolution choices for different regions under different energy/accuracy constraints. Experimental studies, involving object detection tasks evaluated traces from two benchmark urban monitoring datasets as well as a prototype Raspberry Pi-based MRIM implementation, demonstrate MRIM’s efficacy: even with unoptimized embedded platform, MRIM can provide system energy savings of 35+% or increase task accuracy by 8+%, over conventional baselines of uniform resolution downscaling or image encoding, while supporting high throughput.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-1643-6","10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762398","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762398","Mixed resolution;imaging tasks;energy consumption","Pervasive computing;Image resolution;Energy resolution;Pipelines;Imaging;Prototypes;Vision sensors","","8","","28","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cutting-edge research in implantable medical devices (IMDs) has shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) applied to intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) data can predict seizures up to an hour before onset. However, offloading of iEEG data to the edge/cloud is highly prohibitive, due to the sheer size of the generated data. Existing work either focuses on the DNN training phase only, or does not consider the severe energy/space limitations of IMDs. Moreover, the technical aspects of patient personalization, which allows for patient-specific hyper-parameter tuning, still remain unaddressed. In this paper, we propose a platform called AiEEG for in vivo early seizure prediction, whose DNN hardware circuitry can be reconfigured remotely without surgery. We prototype AiEEG on a system on chip (SoC) platform and demonstrate its end-to-end capabilities in seizure prediction with a population of 30 epileptic patients, with iEEG signals coming from a real-world dataset. Extensive experimental results shows that (i) our embedded and personalized DNN has an area under the curve (AUC) averaging at 0.97 and as low as zero false positives per hour (FPH) for over half the patients, an improvement of about 3.5x with respect to a non-personalized prediction method and the best for a dataset of this size when compared to the state-of-the-art; (ii) our AiEEG platform consumes 4.2x less energy than a cloud-based approach, leading to a 4x battery lifetime improvement; (iii) we are able to remotely fine-tune the DNN through partial reconfiguration as needed in about 10s.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-1643-6","10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762383","Ultrasound;Wireless;IoT;Deep Learning;Seizure Prediction","Deep learning;Wireless communication;Training;Ultrasonic imaging;Neural networks;Sociology;Surgery","","4","","46","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a new adaptive machine learning system, called CountMeIn, to address the crowd estimation problem using polynomial regression and neural networks. The approach transfers the calibration task from cameras to machine learning after a short training with people counting from stereoscopic cameras, Wi-Fi probe packets, and temporal features. After the training, CountMeIn calibrates Wi-Fi using the trained model and maintains high accuracy for a longer duration without cameras. We test the approach in our pilot study in Gold Coast, Australia, for about five months.

"Weight Separation for Memory-Efficient and Accurate Deep Multitask Learning","S. Lee; S.

The goal of weight separation is to achieve extreme packing of multiple heterogeneous DNNs into the limited memory of the system while ensuring the prediction accuracy of the constituent DNNs at the same time. The proposed approach separates the DNN weights into two types of weight-pages consisting of a subset of weight parameters, i.e., shared and exclusive weight-pages. It optimally distributes the weight-pages into two levels of the system memory hierarchy and stores them separately, i.e., the shared weight-pages in primary (level-1) memory (e.g., RAM) and the exclusive weight-pages in secondary (level-2) memory (e.g., flask disk or SSD). First, to reduce the memory usage of multiple DNNs, less critical weight parameters are identified and overlapped onto the shared weight-pages that are deployed in the limited space of the primary (main) memory. Next, to retain the prediction accuracy of multiple DNNs, the essential weight parameters that play a critical role in preserving prediction accuracy are stored intact in the plentiful space of secondary memory storage in the form of exclusive weight-pages without overlapping. We implement two real systems applying the proposed weight separation: 1) a microcontroller-based multitask IoT system that performs multitask learning of 10 scaled-down DNNs by separating the weight parameters into FRAM and flash disk, and 2) an embedded GPU system that performs multitask learning of 10 state-of-the-art DNNs, separating the weight parameters into GPU RAM and eMMC. Our evaluation shows that memory efficiency, prediction accuracy, and execution time of deep multitask learning improve up to 5.9x, 2.0%, and 13.1x, respectively, without any modification of DNN models.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-1643-6","10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762400","deep neural networks;multitask learning;parameter sharing;embedded intelligence;on-device AI","Deep learning;Pervasive computing;Embedded systems;Nonvolatile memory;Ferroelectric films;Memory management;Neural networks","","","","50","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The increase in traffic presents many challenges to user-centric networks, network operators, and service providers. Foremost among these challenges is the inability of networks to determine the types of encrypted traffic and thus the level of network service the traffic needs for maintaining an acceptable quality of experience. Therefore, end devices are a natural fit for performing traffic classification since end devices have more contextual information about the device usage and traffic. This paper proposes a novel approach that classifies multimedia traffic types produced and consumed on mobile devices. The technique relies on a mobile device’s detection of its multimedia context characterized by its utilization of different media input/output components, e.g., camera, microphone, and speaker. We develop an algorithm, MediaSense, which senses the states of multiple I/O components and identifies the specific multimedia context of a mobile device in real-time. We demonstrate that MediaSense classifies encrypted multimedia traffic in real-time as accurately as deep learning approaches and with even better generalizability.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-1643-6","10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762389","Academy of Finland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762389","multimedia context;deep learning;traffic classification;VoIP;streaming;broadcast","Digital multimedia broadcasting;Deep learning;Pervasive computing;Multimedia computing;Streaming media;Mobile handsets;Real-time systems","","1","","41","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking a deep generative modeling approach and through a tailored conditional generator design, CartaGenie can synthesize high-fidelity and artifact-free spatial traffic snapshots using only contextual information about the target geographical region that is easily found in public repositories. Hence, CartaGenie allows researchers to create their own realistic datasets of spatial traffic from open data about their region of interest. Experiments with real-world mobile traffic measurements collected in multiple metropolitan areas show that CartaGenie can produce dependable network traffic loads for areas where no prior traffic information is available, significantly outperforming a comprehensive set of benchmarks. Moreover, tests with practical case studies demonstrate that the synthetic data generated by CartaGenie is as good as real data in supporting diverse research-oriented mobile traffic data-driven applications.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-1643-6","10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762395","Mobile network traffic data;Traffic snapshots;Synthetic data generation;Deep generative models","Pervasive computing;Conferences;Computational modeling;Urban areas;Telecommunication traffic;Generators;Spatial databases","","3","","45","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We performed a field study with 93 participants to collect their privacy decisions, the surrounding context and whether each request was expected. The collected 65261 permission decisions revealed a strong misalignment between apps’ practices and expectation as almost half of requests are unexpected by users. This ratio strongly varies with the requested permission, the category and visibility of the requesting application and the user itself; that is, expectation is subjective to each individual. Moreover, privacy decisions are most strongly correlated with user expectation, but such correlation is also highly personal.

The occurrence of such events is a consequence of peak loads, often due to extreme outside temperatures that simultaneously trigger Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. Leveraging pervasive computing technologies, such as smart meters and smart thermostats, this paper introduces a comprehensive approach to perform residential HVAC power conservation and prevent these catastrophic events. Differently from previous solutions, our approach models realistic user behavior and HVAC dynamics of individual homes. Specifically, we formulate a novel reverse auction-based problem, called POwer Conservation Optimization (POCO). The goal is to perform power conservation by motivating users to temporarily adjust their HVAC thermostat settings in exchange for financial rewards. We prove that POCO ensures truthfulness and individual rationality of the auction mechanism, although it is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, we propose an efficient heuristic, called Greedy Ranking AllocatioN (GRAN), which we prove ensures the same formal properties, while incurring only a polynomial complexity. To predict power savings resulting from an HVAC thermostat adjustments, we propose a novel machine learning-based technique called Power Saving Prediction (PSP). In addition, we conduct an online survey to study the willingness to adopt the proposed system and to model realistic user behavior. Survey results show willingness of adoption above 79% and a highly heterogeneous and non-linear user behavior. We perform extensive experiments using high-fidelity simulator EnergyPlus. Results show that PSP outperforms a state-of-the-art solution obtaining 85% predictions within a 5% error margin. Furthermore, GRAN achieves near-optimal performance, outperforming a recent state-of-the-art approach obtaining results between 58% and 68% closer to the optimum.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-1643-6","10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762402","HVAC power conservation;machine learning power saving predictions;reverse auctions;smart homes;cyber-physical pervasive computing","Pervasive computing;HVAC;Power system dynamics;Machine learning;Smart homes;Ventilation;Smart meters","","6","","59","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is due to the huge variability of the way different people execute even the simplest actions. In addition, detailed sensor fixtures and placement will be different for different people or even at different times for the same users. In theory, the problem can be solved by a large enough data set. However, recording data sets that capture the entire diversity of complex activity sets is seldom practicable. Instead, models are needed that focus on features that are invariant across users. To this end, we present an adversarial subject-independent feature extraction method with the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) regularization for human activity recognition. The proposed model is capable of learning a subject-independent embedding feature representation from multiple subjects datasets and generalizing it to unseen target subjects. The proposed network is based on the adversarial encoder-decoder structure with the MMD to realign the data distribution over multiple subjects. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods over the four real-world datasets but also improves the subject generalization effectively.

Centralized supervised approaches reach very high recognition rates, but they incur privacy and scalability issues. Federated Learning (FL) has been recently proposed to mitigate these issues. Each subject only shares the weights of a personal model trained locally, instead of sharing data. A cloud server is in charge of aggregating the weights to generate a global model. However, since activity data is non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID), a single model may not be sufficiently accurate for a large number of diverse users. In this work, we propose FedCLAR, a novel federated clustering method for HAR. Based on the similarity of the local model updates, the cloud server in FedCLAR derives groups of users that exhibit similar ways of performing activities. For each group, FedCLAR uses a specialized global model to mitigate the non-IID problem. We evaluated FedCLAR on two well-known public datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art FL solutions.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-1643-6","10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762352","human activity recognition;federated learning;clustering","Pervasive computing;Privacy;Computational modeling;Scalability;Distributed databases;Medical services;Activity recognition","","15","","41","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The execution of such tasks often yields the same results (output) and thus duplicate (redundant) computation. Based on this observation, prior work has advocated for “computation reuse”, a paradigm where the results of previously executed tasks are stored at the edge and are reused to satisfy incoming tasks with similar input data, instead of executing these incoming tasks from scratch. However, realizing computation reuse in practical edge computing deployments, where services may be offered by multiple (distributed) edge nodes (servers) for scalability and fault tolerance, is still largely unexplored. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present Reservoir, a framework to enable pervasive computation reuse at the edge, while imposing marginal overheads on user devices and the operation of the edge network infrastructure. Reservoir takes advantage of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and runs on top of Named-Data Networking (NDN), extending the NDN architecture for the realization of the computation reuse semantics in the network. Our evaluation demonstrated that Reservoir can reuse computation with up to an almost perfect accuracy, achieving 4.25–21.34× lower task completion times compared to cases without computation reuse.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-1643-6","10.1109/PerCom53586.2022.9762397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9762397","Edge Computing;Computation Reuse;Locality Sensitive Hashing;Named-Data Networking","Pervasive computing;Smart cities;Image edge detection;Scalability;Semantics;Image annotation;Reservoirs","","11","","36","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current wearer foreground extraction methods that depend on image data alone are slow, energy-inefficient, and even inaccurate in some cases, making many tasks–like activity recognition–challenging to implement in the absence of significant computational resources.

We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting blurred faces, achieving up to 95% accuracy.

Content caching at the edge has also been proposed to reduce the delivery latency. Though, combining these two mechanisms have potential advantages, applying conventional tile-based caching, which primarily tries to find identical tiles, is not feasible due to the high diversity in tile area and location in variable tiles. To this end, we propose OpCASH, an ILP based mechanism to devise optimal cache tile configuration at a MEC server to provide a non-overlapping tile cover for a given VP request in variable tiles, while minimizing the requests to remote servers and reducing the delivery latency. Experimental trace-driven simulation results show that we can achieve more than 95% of VP coverage from cache after just 24 views of the video.
