"Panel","",,2021 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom),"25 May 2021","2021","","","i","i","Summary form only given. An infrastructure is called critical (CRITIS) if its disruption poses a severe threat to public life. During the recent pandemics, videoconferencing, home office/schooling, and global virus data dashboards made the public aware of how dependent we have become on ""the Internet"", or rather on ICT (information and communication technology): ICT has truly become a CRITIS. The most frightening aspect in this trend is the fact that ICT is known, from both everyday experience and serious studies, to be fragile i.e. vulnerable and for the most part rather unreliable. This is why the ICT that functions as the 'nervous system' of the power grid, and of any other CRITIS, must be resilient. A particular subject of CRITIS resilience are multi-sector urban CRITIS: the growth and mechanization of cities led to a complex interwoven network of traffic, power, heating, municipal supply and disposal, etc., both indispensable for citizens and fragile. Recently, R&D efforts around Smart Cities showed that the increasing urban challenges, from pollution to traffic gridlock, from rural-urban migration to gentrification, call for ICT as a key factor in the complicated city equation. However, increasing natural catastrophes, human errors, technical threads (e.g., from nearby chemical or nuclear plants) and attacks / cyberattacks are heavily threatening the critical urban infrastructures. In summary, all of the above leads to the key panel questions: How to morph ICT from the problem into the solution for resilience-both for common CRITIS like the power grid and for smart cities i.e. urban infrastructures? This question can be divided into two parts. How to reach resilience FOR ICT i.e. how can ICT be made resilient? How to reach resilience THROUGH ICT i.e. how can ICT help to make other infrastructures more resilient rather than more fragile? The panel will initially address these questions from a more general perspective, before diving into issues related to the role of PerCom technologies such as: The role of PerCom technologies - for increased fragility or greater resilience Key PerCom design principles and concepts that may yield resilience.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439138","","Resilience;Pervasive computing;Information and communication technology;Conferences;Smart cities;Privacy;Nervous system","","","","","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Mobility Improves Accuracy: Precise Robot Manipulation with COTS RFID Systems","H. Wang; S. Chen; W. Gong",University of Science and Technology of China; Simon Fraser University; University of Science and Technology of China,2021 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom),"25 May 2021","2021","","","1","10","This paper presents GLAC, the first 3D localization system that enables millimeter-level object manipulation for robotics using only COTS RFID devices. The key insight of GLAC is that mobility reduces ambiguity and thus improves accuracy. Unlike state-of-the-art systems that require extra time or hardware to boost performance, it draws the power of modeling mobility in a delicate way. In particular, we build a novel framework for real-time tracking using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In our framework, multiple Kalman filters are designed to take a single phase observation for updating mobility states, and a fast inference algorithm is proposed to efficiently process an exponentially large number of candidate trajectories. We prototype GLAC with only UHF tags and a commercial reader of four antennas. Comprehensive experiments show that the median position accuracies of x/y/z dimensions are within 1 cm for both LoS and NLoS cases. The median position accuracy for slow-moving targets is 0.41 cm, which is 2.2×, 17.3×, and 14.9× better than TurboTrack, Tagoram, and RF-IDraw, respectively. Also, its median velocity accuracy is at least 20 better than all three competitors for fast-moving targets. Besides accuracy, it achieves more than 4× localization time gains over state-of-the-art systems.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439133","RFID;Real-time Tracking;High speed","Location awareness;Three-dimensional displays;Welding;Hidden Markov models;Surgery;UHF antennas;Real-time systems","","5","","57","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally performed using custom hardware, attached to a subject's body, revisiting BCG for the smartphone, held in hand, faces several challenges. The hand is an external organ furthest from the aorta and subject to motion artifacts, leading to a weak and noisy signal, while the position the phone is held in can impact which accelerometer axis best captures BCG. HandRate addresses these challenges by introducing a design involving two modules operating in tandem: the first aimed at transforming the accelerometer readings into a single-dimensional signal oblivious to how the phone is held, while the second module making heartbeat predictions based on this signal. Results from testing HandRate using data collected from 18 subjects show that it can estimate heart rate with accuracy similar to or better than systems requiring special sensors and/or active user participation.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439134","Agence Nationale de la Recherche; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439134","Heart Activity Monitoring;Hand-based Ballis-tocardiography;Mobile Sensing;Heartbeats detection","Accelerometers;Pervasive computing;Heart beat;Sensors;Noise measurement;Motion measurement;Monitoring","","4","","57","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, small-scale servers are deployed at the edge of network (i.e., edge servers) to `help' cloud servers process data IoT devices constantly generate. However, these edge servers often struggle to deal with emerging applications that require real-time data processing in situ, such as real-time facial recognition. In this paper, we present iEdge as an IoT-assisted edge computing framework that enables the seamless execution of applications across an edge server and nearby IoT devices. The seamless execution in essence has been realized by transforming platform-dependent monolithic applications to cross-platform composite applications and offloading some tasks/functions of these composite applications to IoT devices considering device context. We have evaluated iEdge using a prototype implementation with a real-time facial recognition application. Experimental results show that iEdge effectively harnesses smart IoT devices as a consolidated edge computing execution environment and enables such an application to process more video streams than typical `edge-only' computing.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439122","Edge computing;Internet of Things;Fog computing;IoT-assisted edge computing;In-site data analytics","Pervasive computing;Cloud computing;Face recognition;Prototypes;Streaming media;Real-time systems;Servers","","6","","25","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the present paper, we developed a Dense Indoor Sensor Network (DISN) with 390 sensor nodes and three gateways and empirically evaluated its performance for half a year. Our analysis of more than 14 million transmissions revealed that DISNs achieve a much lower distance coverage compared to previous research. In addition, the deployment of multiple gateways decreased the loss of transmissions due to environmental and network factors such as concurrently received messages. Given the complexity of our system, we received few colliding concurrent messages, which demonstrates a gap between the projected requirements of LoRaWAN systems and the actual requirements of real-world applications. Our attenuation model indicates that robust coverage in an indoor environment can be maintained by placing a gateway every 30 m and every 5 floors. We discuss the application of DISNs for the passive sensing and visualization of human presence using a Digital Twin (DT).","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439137","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439137","","Wide area networks;Upper bound;Computational modeling;Wires;Logic gates;Predictive models;Sensors","","3","","51","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practice, the availability of such information is a challenge as it requires continuous collection of sensory signals. In this study, we design an end-to-end transfer learning framework for parking availability sensing to predict parking occupancy in areas in which the parking data is insufficient to feed into data-hungry models. This framework overcomes two main challenges: 1) many real-world cases cannot provide enough data for most existing data-driven models, and 2) it is difficult to merge sensor data and heterogeneous contextual information due to the differing urban fabric and spatial characteristics. Our work adopts a widely-used concept, adversarial domain adaptation, to predict the parking occupancy in an area without abundant sensor data by leveraging data from other areas with similar features. In this paper, we utilise more than 35 million parking data records from sensors placed in two different cities, one a city centre and the other a coastal tourist town. We also utilise heterogeneous spatio-temporal contextual information from external resources, including weather and points of interest. We quantify the strength of our proposed framework in different cases and compare it to the existing data-driven approaches. The results show that the proposed framework is comparable to existing state-of-the-art methods and also provide some valuable insights on parking availability prediction.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439123","transfer learning;parking availability;sensor network;transportation","Pervasive computing;Adaptation models;Urban areas;Transfer learning;Sea measurements;Predictive models;Data models","","17","","36","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Acting both as leisure devices, providing personal audio, as well as sensing platforms, earables could collect sensor data for the upper part of the body, subject to fewer vibrations and random movement variations than the lower parts of the body, due to inherent damping in the musculoskeletal system. These data may enable application domains such as augmented/virtual reality, medical rehabilitation, and health condition screening. Unfortunately, earables have inherent size, shape, and weight constraints limiting the type and position of the sensors on such platforms. For instance, lacking a magnetometer in all earables reference platforms, earables lack reference points. Thus, it becomes harder to work with absolute orientations. Embedding magnetometers in earables is challenging, as these rely heavily on radio (mostly Bluetooth) communication (RF) and contain magnets for magnetic-driven speakers and docking. We explore the feasibility of adding a built-in magnetometer in an earbud, presenting the first comprehensive study of the magnetic interference impacting the magnetometer when placed in an earable: both that caused by the speaker and by RF (music streaming and voice calls) are considered. We find that appropriate calibration of the magnetometer removes the offsets induced by the magnets, the speaker, and the variable interference due to BT. Further, we present an automatic, user-transparent adaptive calibration that obviates the need for alternative, expensive, and error-prone manual, or robotics, calibration procedures. Our evaluation shows how our calibration approach performs under different conditions, achieving convincing results with errors below 3° for the majority of the experiments.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439112","","Radio frequency;Vibrations;Magnetometers;Magnetomechanical effects;Wearable computers;Magnetic domains;Interference","","1","","42","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These problems lead to the difficulties in constructing robust feature representations that might negatively affect the quality of recognition. This study, for the first time, applies deep triplet networks with various triplet loss functions and mining methods to the Human Activity Recognition task. Moreover, we introduce a novel method for constructing hard triplets by exploiting similarities between subjects performing the same activities using the concept of Hierarchical Triplet Loss. Our deep triplet models are based on the recent state-of-the-art LSTM networks with two attention mechanisms. The extensive experiments conducted in this paper identify important hyperparameters and settings for training deep metric learning models on widely-used open-source Human Activity Recognition datasets. The comparison of the proposed models against the recent benchmark models shows that deep metric learning approach has the potential to improve the quality of recognition. Specifically, at least one of the implemented triplet networks shows the state-of-the-art results for each dataset used in this study, namely PAMAP2, USC-HAD and MHEALTH. Another positive effect of applying deep triplet networks and especially the proposed sampling algorithm is that feature representations are less affected by inter-class similarities and subject heterogeneity issues.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439116","","Measurement;Training;Adaptation models;Wearable computers;Conferences;Activity recognition;Benchmark testing","","32","","34","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the explosive increase in the sensing data volume, it becomes difficult to collect and process all the data in one central place. On one hand, storing and processing data on edge devices, so called edge computing, is becoming important. On the other hand, edge devices usually have only limited computing and memory resources, and hence it is not practical to process and save all the acquired data. There is a great demand of effectively selecting data to process on an edge device or to transfer it to a cloud server. In this paper, we propose an efficient density-based data selection and management method called O-D2M by which edge devices store the data representing inherent data distribution. We use a low cost graph algorithm to analyze input data trend and its density. We evaluate effectiveness of the proposed O-D2M comparing to other methods in terms of the accuracy of machine learning models trained by the selected data. Throughout the evaluation, we confirm that O-D2M obtains higher accuracy and lower computation cost while it can reduce the amount of data to be processed or transferred by up to 20 points.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439127","edge computing;data management","Pervasive computing;Performance evaluation;Time-frequency analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Market research","","5","","36","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many factors can affect the reliability of such self-report surveys, such as participants' trusty and ambiguous descriptions in questionnaires. These inaccurate survey labels challenge the development of the models, especially when it comes to the case where deep learning approaches tend to memorize the noisy information from training data. In this paper, we set out to deal with the noisy self-report survey labels. We aim to address the following challenges: 1)the limited access to clean labeled data in real-world scenarios; 2)different noise ratio of the data from different participants; 3)various types of noise that appear in the data; 4)how to evaluate the reliability of participants. As such, we propose a generalizable model, Lan, for learning from multi-modal sensory data and noisy labels.

However, in human-centric applications, the amount of harvested kinetic energy is not enough to power a real-time activity recognition algorithm and run the wearable device perpetually. In this paper, we propose Solar based human Activity Recognition (SolAR), which uses solar cells simultaneously as an activity sensor as well as an energy source. Our key observation is that the power available from a wrist-worn solar cell changes dynamically while a person moves, encoding information about the underlying activity. We collect empirical solar energy data to explore its activity sensing potential and implement the activity recognition pipeline on an ultra low-power micro-controller unit to evaluate the end-to-end power consumption of the system. Our analysis reveals that SolAR improves activity recognition accuracy by up to 8.3% and harvests more than one order of magnitude higher power compared to its kinetic counterpart.

The experiment results with commercial smartphones show that GAZEL achieves 27.5% better accuracy on smartphones compared to the state-of-the-art techniques and provides gaze tracking at up to 18 fps which is practically usable at runtime.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439113","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439113","runtime;gaze tracking;mobile;smartphone;transfer learning;head pose","Pervasive computing;Visualization;Runtime;Transfer learning;Gaze tracking;Computer architecture;Data models","","7","","38","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are major obstacles to crowdsensing, including the preservation of privacy. The consideration of privacy in crowdsensing systems has led to two main approaches, sometimes combined, which are, respectively, to trade privacy for rewards, and to take advantage of privacy-enhancing technologies ""anonymizing"" the collected data. Although relevant, we claim that these approaches do not sufficiently take into account the users’ own tolerance to the use of the data provided, so that the crowdsensing system guarantees users the expected level of confidentiality as well as fosters the use of crowdsensing data for different tasks. To this end, we introduce the ℓ-completeness property, which ensures that the data provided can be used for all the tasks to which their owners consent as long as they are analyzed with ℓ − 1 other sources, and that no privacy violations can occur due to the related contribution of users with less stringent privacy requirements. The challenge, therefore, is to ensure ℓ-completeness when analyzing the data while allowing the data to be used for as many tasks as possible and promoting the accuracy of the resulting knowledge. We address this challenge with a clustering algorithm sensitive to the data distribution, which is shown to optimize data reuse and utility using a dataset from a deployed crowdsensing application.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439125","Crowdsensing;Privacy;Consent","Pervasive computing;Data privacy;Privacy;Crowdsensing;Conferences;Data models;Resource management","","2","","51","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to performance gains, offloading helps to reduce energy consumption of mobile devices, which is a key challenge in pervasive computing research and industry. In today's distributed computing systems, the decision whether to execute a task locally or remotely for minimal energy usage is non-trivial. Uncertainty about the task complexity and the result data size require a careful offloading decision. In this paper, we present Voltaire— a novel scheduler for sophisticated energy-aware code offloading decisions. Voltaire applies machine learning methods on crowd-sourced data about past executions to accurately predict the complexity and the result data size of an upcoming task. Combining these predictions with device-specific energy profiles and context knowledge allows Voltaire to estimate the energy consumption on the mobile device. Thus, Voltaire makes well-informed offloading decisions and carefully selects local or remote execution based on the expected energy consumption. We integrate Voltaire into the Tasklet distributed computing system and perform extensive experiments in a real-world testbed. Our results with three real-world applications show that Voltaire reduces the energy usage of task executions by 12.5% compared to a baseline scheduler.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439121","energy-aware code offloading;mobile ad-hoc computing;machine learning;Tasklet system","Pervasive computing;Energy consumption;Uncertainty;Runtime;Machine learning;Mobile handsets;Complexity theory","","5","","45","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With high agility, mobility and flexibility, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is widely considered as a promising technology for data collection in WSNs. Under the one-to-many data collection scheme, where a UAV is able to collect data from multiple sensors simultaneously within its reception range, the identification of hovering locations of the UAV impacts the efficiency of data collection significantly. Most existing studies either neglect this critical issue or discretize the UAV serving area into small regions with a given size, which results in the inevitable utility loss of data collection. In this paper, we jointly consider the hovering location positioning of the UAV and the utility maximization of data collection. Specifically, we first formulate a novel data collection utility maximization problem (UMP) and show that it is an NP-hard problem. We then devise an efficient algorithm for precisely positioning (potential) UAV hovering locations, which improves the data collection utility significantly. We also propose an approximation algorithm for UMP with approximation ratio $\left( {1 - \frac{1}{e}} \right)$, where e is the base of the natural logarithm. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through simulation experiments, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform four heuristics.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439126","Australian Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439126","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV);wireless sensor networks (WSNs);Internet of Things (IoT);data collection;approximation algorithms;utility maximization;energy efficiency","Pervasive computing;Wireless sensor networks;NP-hard problem;Heuristic algorithms;Simulation;Data collection;Approximation algorithms","","17","","28","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two major developments have gained significant momentum recently: an advanced use of edge resources and the integration of machine learning techniques for engineering applications. This evolution raises major challenges, in particular related to the appropriate distribution of computing elements along an edge-to-cloud continuum. About this, Federated Learning has been recently proposed for distributed model training in the edge. The principle of this approach is to aggregate models learned on distributed clients in order to obtain a new, more general model. The resulting model is then redistributed to clients for further training. To date, the most popular federated learning algorithm uses coordinate-wise averaging of the model parameters for aggregation. However, it has been shown that this method is not adapted in heterogeneous environments where data is not identically and independently distributed (non-iid). This corresponds directly to some pervasive computing scenarios where heterogeneity of devices and users challenges machine learning with the double objective of generalization and personalization. In this paper, we propose a novel aggregation algorithm, termed FedDist, which is able to modify its model architecture (here, deep neural network) by identifying dissimilarities between specific neurons amongst the clients. This permits to account for clients' specificity without impairing generalization. Furthermore, we define a complete method to evaluate federated learning in a realistic way taking generalization and personalization into account. Using this method, FedDist is extensively tested and compared with three state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on the pervasive domain of Human Activity Recognition with smartphones.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439129","Federated Learning;algorithm;evaluation;Human Activity Recognition","Pervasive computing;Training;Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Neurons;Machine learning","","45","","40","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applications are often backed by models that learn from the user's experiences to provide personalized and responsive behavior. While models are often pre-trained on massive datasets, federated learning has gained attention for its ability to train globally shared models on users' private data without requiring the users to share their data directly. However, federated learning requires devices to collaborate via a central server, under the assumption that all users desire to learn the same model. We define a new approach, opportunistic federated learning, in which individual devices belonging to different users seek to learn robust models that are personalized to their user's own experiences. However, instead of learning in isolation, these models opportunistically incorporate the learned experiences of other devices they encounter opportunistically. In this paper, we explore the feasibility and limits of such an approach, culminating in a framework that supports encounter-based pairwise collaborative learning. The use of our opportunistic encounter-based learning amplifies the performance of personalized learning while resisting overfitting to encountered data.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439130","pervasive computing;federated learning;collaborative deep learning;distributed machine learning","Pervasive computing;Performance evaluation;Computational modeling;Conferences;Collaboration;Machine learning;Collaborative work","","27","","39","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The response times of multi-DNN highly affect users’ quality of experience and safety as well. Different DNNs exhibit diversified resource requirements and execution patterns across layers and networks, which may easily exceed the available device memory and riskily degrade the responsiveness. In this paper, we design and implement Masa, a responsive memory-aware multi-DNN execution framework, an on-device middleware featuring on modeling inter- and intra-network dependency and leveraging complimentary memory usage of each layer. Masa can consistently ensure the average response time when deterministically and stochastically executing multiple DNN-based image analyses. We extensively evaluate Masa on three configurations of Raspberry Pi and a large set of popular DNN models triggered by different generation patterns of images. Our evaluation results show that Masa can achieve lower average response times by up to 90% on devices with small memory, i.e., 512 MB to 1 GB, compared to the state of the art multi-DNN scheduling solutions.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439111","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439111","Multiple DNNs inference;average response time;edge devices;memory-aware scheduling","Pervasive computing;Schedules;Image analysis;Processor scheduling;Image edge detection;Real-time systems;Safety","","13","","36","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A complete record of the panel discussion was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. An infrastructure is called critical (CRITIS) if its disruption poses a severe threat to public life. Electricity and water are commonly cited examples, but the list comprises the food supply chain, the public health system, and more. During the recent pandemics, videoconferencing, home office / schooling, and global virus data dashboards made the public aware of how dependent we have become on ""the Internet"", or rather on ICT (information and communication technology): ICT has truly become a CRITIS. Not only that: ICT is becoming ever more important for the correct functioning of all other infrastructures: finance is already fully dependent on ICT, food and health supply are organized using ICT, even the upcoming smart (power) grid uses ICT as its ‘nervous system’. The most frightening aspect in this trend is the fact that ICT is known, from both everyday experience and serious studies, to be fragile i.e. vulnerable and for the most part rather unreliable. Nobody wants to picture a future with electricity ‘crashing/rebooting’ twice a day, being unavailable due to software updates, flickering due to congestion, being heavily affected by various hazards, or becoming unavailable for days due to cyberattacks. This is why the ICT that functions as the ‘nervous system’ of the power grid, and of any other CRITIS, must be resilient: Resilient means-roughly speaking-undisturbed by mild and medium-scale harm; continuing to function, at least in an emergency mode, even after serious damage; fast-recovering; and learning from (real or modelled/simulated) emergencies ‘experienced’.","2474-249X","978-1-6654-0418-1","10.1109/PERCOM50583.2021.9439124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439124","","Resilience;Pervasive computing;Conferences;Information and communication technology;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Stakeholders","","1","","","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
