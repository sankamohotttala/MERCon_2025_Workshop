We propose, design, and implement a smartwatch-based two-factor real-time identification and authentication system named ThumbUp, where smartwatch users can identify and authenticate themselves by some simple hand and finger gestures, such as thumb-up. ThumbUp leverages the signal collected from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) smart devices and discovers the unique fingerprint pattern produced by each user’s simple hand gestures using a carefully crafted deep learning model. We implement our system and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its efficacy and efficiency with 65 different users over a period of more than 3 months. It reaches an accuracy of 97% for identification, and EER 0.014 for authentication using only one simple gesture.

Rogue AP attacks can potentially cause severe privacy leakage and financial lost. Hardware fingerprinting is the state-of-the-art technology to detect rogue APs, since an attacker would find it difficult to set up a rogue AP with specific hardware fingerprints. However, existing hardware fingerprints not only depend on the AP, but also depend on the client, significantly limiting their applicable scenarios. In this work, we investigate two novel client-agnostic fingerprints, which can be extracted using commercial off-the-shelf WiFi devices, to detect rogue APs. One is the power amplifier non-linearity fingerprint and the other is the frame interval distribution fingerprint. These two fingerprints remain consistent over time and space for the same AP but vary across different APs even with the same brand, model and firmware. We use the fingerprint similarity between the candidate AP and the authorized AP for device authentication. Our scheme can be implemented without modifying the infrastructural APs and can work well with new clients without rebuilding the fingerprint database. We evaluate our scheme in both in-lab and field scenarios, by analyzing 12 million WiFi packets. Results shows that our scheme achieves an overall 96.55% positive detection rate and a 4.31% false alarm rate.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127375","","Wireless communication;Pervasive computing;Privacy;Databases;Authentication;Power amplifiers;Fingerprint recognition","","14","","31","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous approaches commonly assume that adequately long and fixed periods of candidate participants’ historical mobility trajectories are available before the selection process. This enables the frameworks to accurately model mobility which enables the optimization of selection. However, this assumption may not be realistic for newly-released MCS applications or platforms because the candidates have just boarded without previous mobility profiles. The sparsity or even absence of mobility traces will incur inaccurate location prediction of the individual participant, thus imposing negative effects on the participant selection process and hindering the practical deployment of new MCS applications. To this end, this paper investigates a novel problem called ""From-Scratch MCS"" (FS-MCS for short), in which we study how to intelligently select participants to minimize such ""cold-start"" effect. Specifically, we propose a novel framework based on reinforcement learning, which we name RL-Recruiter. With the gradual accumulation of mobility trajectories over time, RL-Recruiter can make a good sequence of participant selection decisions for each sensing slot by incrementally extracting and utilizing the collective mobility patterns of all candidate participants, thus avoiding the prediction of individual participant’s location that is very inaccurate when the training data is sparse. We test our approach experimentally based on two real-world mobility datasets. Our experiment results demonstrate that RL-Recruiter outperforms the baseline approaches under various settings.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127383","mobile crowdsensing;participant selection;reinforcement learning","Pervasive computing;Crowdsensing;Conferences;Computational modeling;Training data;Reinforcement learning;Trajectory","","8","","38","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current advances on CTC mainly fall into two categories, physical-layer CTC and packet-level energy modulation (PLEM). The physical-layer CTC achieves a high CTC data rate, but with channel incompatible to commercial devices, making it hard to be deployed in current wireless networks. PLEM is channel and physical layer compatible, but with two main drawbacks of the low CTC data rate and MAC incompatibility, which will induce severe interference to the other devices’ normal data transmissions. In this paper, we propose symbol-level energy modulation (SLEM), the first CTC method that is fully compatible with current devices in both channel and the physical/MAC layer processes, having the ability to be deployed in commercial wireless networks smoothly. SLEM attaches the CTC bits to one WiFi data packet through adjusting the energy levels of WiFi symbols, achieving concurrent CTC and WiFi transmissions. We make theoretical analysis to figure out the performance tradeoff between CTC and WiFi, and also conduct experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of SLEM and its performance under different network situations.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127370","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127370","","Pervasive computing;Wireless networks;Conferences;Modulation;Collaboration;Interference;Physical layer","","7","","20","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, recent researches show that attackers can easily recover victims’ PINs in spite of the large number of combinations PIN provides. Existing protection approaches require alteration of the original interaction between the user and PIN-based authentication systems, or still fail if the attacker can observe and mimic the victim’s input behavior. Considering these limitations, we propose a defense system called LightDefender to protect current PIN-based systems from PIN replay attacks using a single ambient light sensor. Specifically, we protect the PIN input by leveraging the biometrics in the received light intensity that is influenced by input behaviors and biological features. To our best knowledge, our work is the first one to protect PIN input using the light intensity. Different from existing approaches, LightDefender does not change the original interaction methods between the user and PIN-based authentication systems, and the extra hardware cost is low. In addition, by leveraging biological differences (e.g. finger length) among different users, LightDefender still claims high-security protection against strong attackers who can mimic the victim’s input behaviors. Experiments with 10 volunteers show that LightDefender can achieve an average true acceptance rate of 95% for normal users. More importantly, LightDefender can correctly reject two types attackers with an average true rejection rate of at least 93.6% without data of new attackers.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127361","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127361","Personal identification number;ambient light;PIN input protection","Pervasive computing;Costs;Biometrics (access control);Fingers;Authentication;Prototypes;Voltage","","2","","40","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A common challenge though, for current radio sensing solutions is to distinguish simultaneous movement from multiple subjects. We present an approach that exploits antenna installations, for instance, found in upcoming 5G technology, to detect and extract activities from spatially scattered human targets in an ad-hoc manner in arbitrary environments and without prior training of the multi-subject detection. We perform receiver-side beamforming and beam-sweeping over different azimuth angles to detect human presence in those regions separately. We characterize the resultant fluctuations in the spatial streams due to human influence using a case study and make the traces publicly available. We demonstrate the potential of this approach through two applications: 1) By feeding the similarities of the resulting spatial streams into a clustering algorithm, we count the humans in a given area without prior training. (up to 6 people in a 22.4 m2 area with an accuracy that significantly exceeds the related work). 2) We demonstrate that simultaneously conducted activities and gestures can be extracted from the spatial streams through blind source separation.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127374","Radio sensing;Training-free crowd counting;Multi-subject recognition;Beamsteering","Training;Pervasive computing;Performance evaluation;Privacy;Smart buildings;Ventilation;Blind source separation","","2","","41","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To evade this breach of location privacy, many of the state-of-the-art studies suggest to impose stringent restrictions over the usage of IMU sensors. However, in this paper, we show that typing and smartphone engagement patterns can act as an alternative modality to sniff the mobility context of a user, even if the IMU sensors are not sampled at all. We develop an adversarial framework, named ConType, which exploits the signatures exposed by typing and smartphone engagement patterns to track the mobility of a user. Rigorous experiments with in-the-wild dataset show that ConType can track the mobility contexts with an average micro-F1 of 0.87 (±0.09), without using IMU data.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a key component in autonomous driving, which is also increasingly adopted in pervasive computing such as smartphones, wearable devices, and IoT networks. Prior work shows CNN-based classification models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, it is uncertain to what extent regression models such as driving models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, the effectiveness of existing defense techniques, and the defense implications for system and middleware builders.This paper presents an in-depth analysis of five adversarial attacks and four defense methods on three driving models. Experiments show that, similar to classification models, these models are still highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This poses a big security threat to autonomous driving and thus should be taken into account in practice. While these defense methods can effectively defend against different attacks, none of them are able to provide adequate protection against all five attacks. We derive several implications for system and middleware builders: (1) when adding a defense component against adversarial attacks, it is important to deploy multiple defense methods in tandem to achieve a good coverage of various attacks, (2) a black-box attack is much less effective compared with a white-box attack, implying that it is important to keep model details (e.g., model architecture, hyperparameters) confidential via model obfuscation, and (3) driving models with a complex architecture are preferred if computing resources permit as they are more resilient to adversarial attacks than simple models.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127389","Autonomous driving;adversarial attack;defense","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Wearable computers;Computer architecture;Information retrieval;Convolutional neural networks;Security","","93","","49","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, the IEEE 802.11-2016 standard has a fine-time measurement (FTM) protocol that can be used to measure the WiFi signal round trip time (RTT). In this paper, we present the design and implementation of WiNar, a WiFi RTT-based indoor location determination system that combines the advantages of both fingerprint and ranging-based techniques to overcome the different challenges of indoor environments. Using commercial-off-the-shelf access points and mobile phones, WiNar leverages the propagation time of the wireless signal with a fingerprinting model to address the multipath, non-line-of-sight, signal attenuation, and interference challenges of the indoor environments. Moreover, when leveraging the round trip time measurements, WiNar does not require clock synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver. We discuss the different components of the system and its implementation on the Android operating system.

In parallel, communication networks are becoming more ubiquitous. Offloading to distant servers can thus overcome the device limitations at the cost of network delays. Multipath networking has been proposed to overcome network limitations but it is not easily adaptable to edge computing due to the server proximity and networking differences. In this article, we extend the current mobile edge offloading models and present a model for multi-server device-to-device, edge, and cloud offloading. We then introduce a new task allocation algorithm exploiting this model for MAR offloading. Finally, we evaluate the allocation algorithm against naive multipath scheduling and single path models through both a real-life experiment and extensive simulations. In case of sub-optimal network conditions, our model allows reducing the latency compared to single-path offloading, and significantly decreases packet loss compared to random task allocation. We also display the impact of the variation of WiFi parameters on task completion. We finally demonstrate the robustness of our system in case of network instability. With only 70% WiFi availability, our system keeps the excess latency below 9 ms. We finally evaluate the capabilities of the upcoming 5G and 802.11ax.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127360","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127360","","Performance evaluation;Adaptation models;5G mobile communication;Computational modeling;Stability analysis;Resource management;Servers","","35","","42","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Batteries, however, have limited capacity and, once depleted, have to be replaced or recharged. Kinetic Energy Harvesting (KEH) allows to convert ambient motion and vibration into usable electricity and can enable batteryless, maintenance free operation of motion sensors. The signal from a KEH transducer correlates with the underlying motion and may thus directly be used for context detection, saving space, cost and energy by omitting the accelerometer. Previous work uses the open circuit or the capacitor voltage for sensing without using the harvested energy to power a load. In this paper, we propose to use other sensing points in the KEH circuit that offer information-rich sensing signals while the energy from the harvester is used to power a load. We systematically analyze multiple sensing signals available in different KEH architectures and compare their performance in a transport mode detection case study. To this end, we develop four hardware prototypes, conduct an extensive measurement campaign and use the data to train and evaluate different classifiers. We show that sensing the harvesting current signal from a transducer can be energy positive, delivering up to ten times as much power as it consumes for signal acquisition, while offering comparable detection accuracy to the accelerometer signal for most of the considered transport modes.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127356","Kinetic;Energy Harvester;Wearables;IoT;Context Detection;Energy Positive Sensing;Sensing Points;Signals","Accelerometers;Vibrations;Pervasive computing;Transducers;Prototypes;Maintenance engineering;Motion detection","","16","","28","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a nutshell the system relies on two components: counting concurrent speakers in overlapping talking sound directly and clustering single-speaker sound by speaker-identity over time. Compared to previously proposed speaker-counting systems models that only cluster single-speaker sound, this system is more accurate and less vulnerable to the overlapping sound in the crowded environment. In addition, counting speakers in overlapping sound also gives the minimal number of speakers so that it also improves the counting accuracy in a quiet environment.Our methodology is inspired by the newly proposed SincNet deep neural network framework which proves to be outstanding and highly efficient in sound processing with raw signals. By transferring the bottleneck layer of SincNet model as features fed to our speaker clustering model we reached a noticeably better performance than previous models who rely on the use MFCC and other engineered features.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127390","","Pervasive computing;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Conferences;Transfer learning;Sensors;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","","5","","24","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We implemented a flexible data collection tool to create error warnings for a production line, which aims to improve the already existing static alarm models. For industrial machines, there are threshold-based alarm models set by prior experiences and observations of the operator. For machines without standardized interfaces and communication protocols, which are not Industry 4.0 compatible, it represents a challenge to implement and add a dynamic and opportunistic system behavior. Machines need to learn from past errors autonomously and adapt the production properties dynamically. We implemented a framework that makes production machines conform to the Internet of Things (IoT) concepts, by making previously non-IoT enabled resources available to get new insights into the production processes.The system component recognition and the database setup is done fully automatically by our developed system.We designed and applied a feature-based data drift model in a real-world industrial setting to determine data deviation between normal and erroneous work-pieces in real-time to predict upcoming erroneous behavior. The drift analysis flagged and predicted work-pieces as erroneous several minutes before the pre-defined machine alarms would have been raised. The resulting flagged sensors and values can be compared to the system determined errors to get new insights into the abnormal machine behavior. For the reduction of downtime, the most valuable immediate result of the system is the ability to notify the operator earlier and reduce overall downtime.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127357","IoT;Industry 4.0;Middleware Platforms;Self Configuring System;Maintenance Prediction;Unsupervised Analytics","Pervasive computing;Protocols;Production;Predictive models;Sensor systems;Data models;Real-time systems","","3","","24","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We assume that the robot's camera captures images of a person and recognizes his/her activities based on skeletal and visual features extracted from the images. A key issue encountered with this method for activity recognition is that it requires the robot to position itself so that it has an adequate field of view of the activities being conducted. For example, if the robot is directly behind a person while observing that person making tea, it will be difficult for the robot to distinguish that activity from other similar activities such as preparing a meal or washing dishes. Our method employs deep reinforcement learning to control the movements of the mobile robot that is observing the activities in order to maximize its recognition accuracy while minimizing its energy consumption related to its movement. We propose effective action- and state-space designs that can achieve early training convergence and highly accurate activity recognition by: (i) incorporating the confidence of the activity recognition output when evaluating the quality of the current state (position), (ii) incorporating the costs of subsequent actions when estimating values for those actions, and (iii) designing an effective action space that accelerates reinforcement learning by restricting the movement space of the robot to the circumference of a circle with a predefined radius centered on the person.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127376","Activity recognition and understanding;Reinforcement learning;Robotics","Training;Energy consumption;Visualization;Robot vision systems;Virtual environments;Reinforcement learning;Activity recognition","","9","","37","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, maintaining the fidelity of lung function estimation on smartphones becomes challenging in unsupervised field environment in presence of other sounds such as coughs, deep inhalation, regular breathing, and speech. In this paper, we present ExhaleSense that detects forced exhalation efforts on smartphones from audio time-series data, distinguishes high fidelity efforts from poor efforts, and estimates lung obstruction. By conducting three studies with 211 pulmonary patients and healthy subjects, we show that ExhaleSense can detect forced exhalation sounds with 96.74% F1-score and estimate lung obstruction with mean absolute error as low as 7.57%. ExhaleSense shifts the gear of smartphone spirometry research from feasibility to ensuring effort quality towards high fidelity lung function estimation in unsupervised field settings.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127355","mobile spirometry;pulmonary patient;audio;data quality","Pervasive computing;Measurement;Force measurement;Gears;Pulmonary diseases;Lung;Estimation","","10","","20","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Rethinking Authorization Management of Web-APIs","B. Suzic; M.

Security mechanisms such as OAuth 2.0 and API keys are commonly applied to manage authorization aspects of such integrations. However, these mechanisms impose functional and security drawbacks both for service providers and their users due to their static design, coarse and context insensitive capabilities, and weak interoperability. Implementing secure, feature-rich, and flexible data sharing services still poses a challenge that many providers face in the process of opening their interfaces to the public.To address these issues, we design the framework that allows pluggable and transparent externalization of authorization functionality for service providers and flexibility in defining and managing security aspects of resource sharing with third parties for their users. Our solution applies a holistic perspective that considers service descriptions, data fragments, security policies, as well as system interactions and states as an integrated space dynamically exposed and collaboratively accessed by agents residing across organizational boundaries.In this work we present design aspects of our contribution and illustrate its practical implementation by analyzing case scenario involving resource sharing of a popular service.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127384","","Authorization;Pervasive computing;Distributed databases;Dynamic scheduling;Data models;Mobile applications;Resource management","","1","","38","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With advances in mobile computing and machine learning techniques, there has been increased interest in using mobile devices to monitor pulmonary diseases. Nevertheless, the current state-of-the-art technology requires active involvement and high-effort input from the users, impeding continuous monitoring of pulmonary conditions. In this work, two algorithms are proposed for passive assessment of pulmonary condition: one for detection of obstructive pulmonary disease and the other for estimation of the pulmonary function in terms of FEV1/FVC ratio, which is an established clinical metric. The algorithms were developed and validated using the data sets from two studies: research study (healthy=40, pathological=91) and in-clinic study (healthy=10, pathological=60). From the cross-study validation where a classifier was trained on the research data set and tested on the in-clinic data set, the detection accuracy of the pathological class was obtained as 73.7% and the F1 score was 84.5% (87.2% precision and 82.0% recall). In our regression analysis, the FEV1/FVC ratio was predicted with a mean absolute error of 8.6%. Our analysis shows promising results and this work presents a meaningful milestone towards the passive assessment of pulmonary functions from spontaneous speech collected from a mobile phone.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127380","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127380","Mobile Computing;Pulmonary Assessment;COPD;Asthma;Natural Speech;Inspiratory Sound","Measurement;Pervasive computing;Pathology;Pulmonary diseases;Natural languages;Lung;Mobile handsets","","18","","40","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Until recently, theories of behavior and its relationship with genetics, health, and the environment have been based on selfreport or human-observed information. Given the meteoric rise of pervasive and machine learning technologies, researchers now have the necessary tools to map a personalized human behaviorome.Despite these recent technology advances, we still face numerous challenges that limit our current ability to learn reliable, complete personal profiles. The ability to perform machine learning-based behavior observation and analysis in uncontrolled environments, where the physical twin lives, is a fundamental requirement. This capability is not only a key to understanding the relationship between behavior and its influences, but also represents an unmet need.In this talk, we highlight methods that have been designed at the WSU CASAS lab to lay the foundation for digitally mapping a human behaviorome. We mention hurdles that were faced along the way, which unexpectedly created new research opportunities. We also tour some of the applications of the human behaviorome that the group is exploring, specifically to impact health and quality of life for adults as they age.","2474-249X","978-1-7281-4657-7","10.1109/PerCom45495.2020.9127354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9127354","","Pervasive computing;Conferences;Sociology;Machine learning;Genetics;Reliability;Statistics","","2","","0","IEEE","29 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
