However, ZCBIs suffer from signaldependent overshoot errors and increased dynamic power consumption due to inherent reset operation. This paper presents a ZCBI that employs a bidirectional two-phase charging scheme and performs the reset operation selectively. A 3rd-order DeltaSigma modulator has been fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS technology using the proposed integrators. The prototype modulator achieves 67-dB SNR and 63-dB SNDR over the bandwidth of 196 kHz with an oversampling ratio of 64.

The ELDC is achieved by shifting the phase of the sampling clock which composes a zero-order feedback loop in phase domain and avoid long latency between quantizer and DAC. The phase shifting is realized by a phase selector which selects the sampling clock from multi-phase clock signals generated by the phase interpolator. To ensure the stability of the ΔΣ ADC, a two-step phase selector is proposed to optimize the latency in the zero-order feedback loop.

In order to move the zero and pole of the noise transfer function (NTF) closer to the unit circle, a structure combining charge pump and two-input comparator is used to provide two gain factors of 2 and 3, respectively, forming an NTF with zero and pole located at (0.875, 0) and (-0.75, 0), respectively. The improved NTF can provide better noise suppression effect than conventional NTFs. To ensure the stability of the ADC, a gain calibration technique is proposed for the two-input comparator to ensure the gain ratio between the 2 input branches, which can prevent the pole from moving outside the unit circle because of the gain mismatch between the comparator's 2 input branches. In addition, the proposed structure can merge the integration cycle into the sampling phase to enhance the conversion speed. Based on the proposed idea, an NS SAR ADC with a 10-bit DAC is designed in 65-nm CMOS, with post-layout simulation results showing that a 76-dB SNDR is achieved with 2.5-MHz signal bandwidth and 40-MS/s sampling rate.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401115","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401115","SAR;error feedback","Simulation;Noise reduction;Stability analysis;Noise shaping;Calibration;Gain;Poles and zeros","","","","7","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed model was then analyzed in a multi-layer power grid, which, for the first time, considered the impacts of the current propagation that exists in the vertical via array connected within the multi-level interconnection to improve the accuracy of the analytical model further.

Some examples include image and digital signal processing applications. At the same time these applications are often used in systems that require high degrees of fault-tolerance. Examples include autonomous driving applications. Thus, in this work we propose a method to reduce the complexity of hardware redundant systems that are amenable to approximate computing such that soft errors outside a maximum specified threshold are detected. This leads to the detection of catastrophic errors, while allowing the system to continue functioning when smaller single event upsets (SEU) occur. The proposed method reduces the complexity of the duplicated module by applying a set of approximations in such a way that the output is guaranteed to operate within a given error range with the exact module. Experimental results show that the proposed approach works well and that area saving between 30% and 19% can be achieved on average for different error ranges compared to the traditional exact duplication with compare approaches.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401605","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401605","","Fault tolerant systems;Approximate computing;Redundancy;Single event upsets;Digital signal processing;Hardware;Complexity theory","","3","","21","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technique is applicable to high speed digital receivers such as those used in coherent optical communications. The key ingredients of the aforementioned technique are MIMO equalization and the backpropagation algorithm used to adapt the coefficients of the equalizer. The work presented here modifies the earlier architecture to reduce the number of required analog mixers by a factor two, and to simplify, also by a factor two, the compensation equalizer responsible for correcting the errors of the analog signal path.

The energy harvester used in the proposed motion sensor is based on the mechanical modulation of liquid on an insulated electrode, which utilizes a technique referred to as reverse electrowetting-on-dielectric (REWOD). The generated AC signal from the REWOD is rectified to a DC voltage using a Schottky diode-based rectifier and boosted subsequently with the help of a linear charge-pump circuit and a low-dropout regulator (LDO). The constant DC voltage from the LDO (1.8 V) powers the motion-sensing read-out circuitry, which converts the generated charge into a proportional output voltage using a charge amplifier. After amplification of the motion data, a 5-bit SAR-ADC (successive-approximation register ADC) digitizes the signal to be transmitted to a remote receiver. Both the CMOS energy harvester circuit including the rectifier, the charge-pump circuit, the LDO, and the read-out circuit including the charge amplifier, and the ADC is designed in the standard 180 nm CMOS technology. The amplified amplitude goes up to 1.76 V at 10 Hz motion frequency, following linearity with respect to the frequency. The generated DC voltage from the REWOD after the rectifier and the charge-pump is found to be 2.4 V, having the voltage conversion ratio (VCR) as 32.65% at 10 Hz of motion frequency. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the rectifier is simulated as high as 68.57% at 10 Hz. The LDO provides the power supply voltage of 1.8 V to the read-out circuit.

On the receiver side of the IC, a frequency shift is performed by a chopper in front of the first-stage instrumentation amplifier (IA). The chopper down- converts the frequency of the incoming signal, which ranges to 10 MHz, to a common intermediate frequency of 10 kHz. As a result, the requirements on the IA bandwidth and the comparator delay are greatly relaxed, leading to a significant power saving. Furthermore, this technique improves the phase accuracy because the time interval corresponding to the phase at a high frequency increases at the down-converted frequency.

By contrast, photoacoustic acoustic resolution (AR) imaging has deeper penetration depth but with degraded imaging resolution.

It helps to aggregate the advantages of both imaging methods without the cost of building extra physical setup. By training the model with experimentally obtained OR image and simulated AR image pairs, the model is able to enhance the image quality from AR image towards OR image to a huge extent.

Implemented in a standard 0.13-μm CMOS process, the ROIC's effective resolution is 21.0 bit at gain 1 and that of 19.8 bit at gain 64.

Measurements obtained on an 8 bit, 4 GS/s TI-ADC test chip fabricated in 130 nm CMOS technology demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique. Backpropagation-based background compensation of TI-ADC is typically used in high-speed digital communication receivers. Historically, the error backpropagation algorithm has been used to train neural networks in machine learning applications. In a TI-ADC compensation application, the error at the symbol detection stage of a digital receiver is processed by the backpropagation algorithm to compute an equivalent error at the TI-ADC output, which otherwise would not be directly observable. Then, the backpropagated error can be applied to train a low-complexity adaptive equalizer which compensates the TI-ADC mismatches. In comparison with prior art, the main advantages of this technique are its robustness, its high convergence speed, and its intrinsic background operation. Measurements with the aforementioned test chip show that the impact of the TI-ADC mismatch on the receiver performance is eliminated. In addition, an improvement in both the SNDR and SFDR of almost 24 dB and 25.6 dB, respectively, is observed at the Nyquist frequency when the compensation is applied.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401576","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401576","","Semiconductor device measurement;Neural networks;Receivers;Backpropagation algorithms;Digital communication;CMOS technology;Robustness","","1","","19","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the complex baseline network, in this work, we introduce a rapid and systematic way to find the near- optimal memory-reduced DCNN option using multiple compression schemes together.

This paper proposes a Haar classifier based face detection architecture that removes unnecessary iterations during classification to further improve the processing speed. The proposed architecture improves the processing speed by 4.46% compared to that of conventional Haar classifier based face detection architectures, for face detection using a VGA image with 30 faces.

One key advantage of HLS is that it allows to generate different micro-architectures from the same behavioral description by simply specifying different mixes of synthesis options. These include, how to synthesize arrays (e.g. RAM or registers), loops (unroll completely, partially or not unroll or pipeline) and functions (inline or not). Ideally, the designer would like to find a mix that leads to the smallest and fastest microarchitecture. However, these design parameters are conflicting which means that there is not a single optimal solution but a range of solutions that form a Pareto-front. Out of all the possible synthesis combinations, the most important ones are the ones that lead to Pareto-optimal micro-architectures that form this front. Thus, automatic HLS design space exploration methods are desirable to efficiently find these micro-architectures automatically. This work investigates how formulating the cost function affects the quality of the exploration and its runtime and proposes a new cost function that leads to better results compared to the traditional formulation based on weighted-sum of the design metrics. We show that the newly proposed cost function leads to better results for three well-known meta-heuristics.

However, due to the huge differences between visible and infrared images, the last layer's feature representations are less discriminative for VI-ReID. To remedy this, we propose a novel deep supervision learning network, namely Dual-path Deep Supervision Network (DDSN), for VI-ReID. Based on the backbone network, DDSN consists of two key modules, (1) a dual-path deep supervision learning (DDSL) module that is plugged into multiple network layers, and (2) a self-attention module that is developed on top of the backbone network. The backbone network extracts multilevel features at lower middle layers, and several DDSL modules utilize these features to generate more discriminative descriptors. Furthermore, we apply the self-attention module for context modeling to capture useful contextual cues as a supplement. By fusing these descriptors, DDSN can utilize both multi-level information and potential contextual information.

The sparse nature of event streams enables efficient downstream processing tasks as they are suited for power-efficient spiking neural networks. One of the challenges associated with neuromorphic vision is the lack of interpretability of event streams. While most application use-cases do not intend for the event stream to be visually interpreted by anything other than a classification network, there is a lost opportunity to integrating these sensors in spaces that conventional high-speed CMOS sensors cannot go. For example, biologically invasive sensors such as endoscopes must fit within stringent power budgets, which do not allow MHz-speeds of image integration. While dynamic vision sensing can fill this void, the interpretation challenge remains and will degrade confidence in clinical diagnostics. The use of generative adversarial networks presents a possible solution to overcoming and compensating for a vision chip's poor spatial resolution and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we methodically apply the Pix2Pix network to naturalize the event stream from spike-converted CIFAR-10 and Linnaeus 5 datasets. The quality of the network is benchmarked by performing image classification of naturalized event streams, which converges to within 2.81% of equivalent raw images, and an associated improvement over unprocessed event streams by 13.19% for the CIFAR-10 and Linnaeus 5 datasets.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401313","computer vision;dynamic vision sensor;generative adversarial networks;neuromorphic","Neuromorphics;Streaming media;Vision sensors;Benchmark testing;Generative adversarial networks;Voltage control;Image reconstruction","","2","","21","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The electromyograph (EMG) is detected and processed by a controller, that decodes and relates the signal to the corresponding position of the prosthetic. Myoelectric signalling is limited in users by two factors: lack of nerve endings corresponding to the position of the amputation, and neurological damage resulting in poor signal control. Improved prosthesis control has been demonstrated by the addition of feedback sensors based on computer vision and inertial measurement units. Computer vision requires a significant level of processing, resulting in a high latency and high power usage. In this paper, we propose a means of overcoming this limitation by use of in-vivo retinal signalling to complement EMG for improved control. This is demonstrated using a real-time conductance- based simulator as the sole method of control for an upper-limb prosthesis. Input image streams are received by a camera and used to activate the combined rod and cone photoreceptor cell responses. This in turn generates a spike train which is counted and averaged over time, and passed to an Arduino-based control system which modulates the behavior of the prosthesis. We seek to use this system to lower the experimental barriers of in-vivo ganglion electrical signalling by presenting a way to use retina emulation.

Our experiments on ResNet for image classification demonstrate that our 8-bit integer networks achieve state-of-the-art performance compared with Google's TensorFlow and NVIDIA's TensorRT. Moreover, we experiment on VDSR for image super-resolution and on VRCNN for compression artifact reduction, both of which serve regression tasks that natively require high inference accuracy.

Supporting an efficient hardware architecture is critical to making effective use of a deep learning approach with proven algorithm performance. One challenge in implementation of deep learning algorithm is to reduce memory bandwidth because a single memory access normally consumes 100* more energy than an arithmetic operation. To reduce the memory bandwidth, deep learning data could be compressed and decompressed before memory write/read operations. Especially, feature maps, which account for a significant portion of the convolutional neural network (CNN), could be compressed further by reducing the correlations between feature map planes. This paper proposes a compression method for feature maps in CNN that adaptively exploits the varying correlation between feature map planes. For every feature map plane, the proposed method searches the most similar plane among nearby planes in the same layer, and compresses the residual of the two planes instead of the plane itself. Experimental results show that the average bit length to store feature maps is reduced by 14.2% compared to the compression without correlation reduction, and the CNN accuracy does not change and additional training is also not required because the proposed method applies lossless compression.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401375","Adaptive Compression;Convolutional neural network;Feature map compression;Memory bandwidth reduction","Deep learning;Training;Correlation;Adaptive systems;Bandwidth;Hardware;Convolutional neural networks","","2","","29","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The exponent is compressed using the Golomb-Rice code, instead of the Huffman code, for an efficient hardware implementation. The compression syntax is carefully designed so that the size of compressed data is not very far from the entropy, which is the theoretical limit, by distinguishing two different types of data used in CNNs. On the other hand, since the mantissa of CNNs data can be hardly compressed by entropy coding, it is simply quantized for data reduction that may not degrade the CNN performance significantly thanks to the error robustness of CNNs. The quantization reduces 23 bits of a mantissa to 4 bits. The experimental results show that the miss rate of a 1 MB compressed cache with the proposed compression method applied is almost similar to that of an uncompressed 2 MB cache without any decrease of the CNN accuracy.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401655","Cache compression;Convolutional neural network;Golomb-Rice code;Quantization","Degradation;Quantization (signal);Syntactics;Robustness;Hardware;Entropy coding;Entropy","","2","","26","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How to guarantee that the SoC is realized based on a minimal die area remains a challenging task. Current state-of-the-art solutions for this macro placement-problem mostly try to tackle the problem based on meta-heuristic- and genetic algorithms. However, although such methods are commonly used for macro placement, they can not guarantee that the macro placement and, therefore the die size is optimal. In this work, we are proposing the utilization of modern satisfiability solvers in order to generate optimized macro placements. To this end, we symbolically formulate the placement problem and forward it to a solver which allows us to obtain optimized solutions for the macro placement problem. In case this is not possible, search space pruning is employed which does not allow to employ the full optimization strategy anymore but still determines feasible results.

These devices operate in volume constrained conditions and therefore have a drawback in terms of energy storage. This means that the converters used for the necessary voltage compliance in these devices must be as efficient as possible. This work describes a system implementing an adaptive converter together with a constant current stimulator. The adaptive converter utilizes a three-stage charge pump with a total of 600 pF on-chip MIM capacitors occupying 1 mm2 area. Fed from a single supply, it can provide 3.3/6/9/12 V output with varying load current between 100 to 900 μA. The converter changes its output, i.e., stimulator supply voltage depending on the digitally controlled stimulation current. This eliminates the unused voltage headroom and provides more efficient operation compared to constant voltage converters. In addition, reduced number of bulky off-chip flying capacitors make the converter appealing for volume constricted stimulators, such as fully implantable cochlear implants. An H-bridge was used to create the stimulation current, enabling single supply operation. Operational stage number and pulse frequency modulation was utilized to configure the output.

Not only the generation of PTAT and CTAT signals, but also the processing and basic A/D conversion is performed in the same feedback loop. This results in a robust and compact solution, that is independent from external clock or other control signals. A prototype sensor occupies only 2475 μm2 silicon area in 16nm FinFET and consumes 30 μA at 0.95 V supply voltage. Across the consumer range, it achieves an accuracy of ± 1.56 °C (3σ) without calibration and a typical conversion speed of 40kS/sec., which are among best-in- class figures.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401138","deep N-well;duty-cycle modulation;NPN bipolar;thermal management;thermal sensor","Temperature sensors;Feedback loop;Circuits and systems;Prototypes;FinFETs;Silicon;Calibration","","3","","16","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider a vital data format for recording information from networked distributed systems: signals on graphs. A significant concern is to protect the privacy of large scales of signals when processed at third parties, such as cloud data centers. A de-facto solution is to outsource encrypted data before they arrive at the third-parties. We propose a novel and efficient privacy-protected outsourced denoising algorithm based on the information-theoretic secure multi-party computation (secure MPC).

However, this requires high-speed analog-to-digital converters and the time complexity to perform Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) operations using conventional digital computers is O(N2). Conversely, memristor crossbars have experimentally demonstrated the ability to perform various signal processing tasks, including Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), in one time-step. In this work, this has been taken a step further by presenting full DFT and IDFT operations using memristive crossbars and proposes the implementation of novel continuous-time tunable analog filters by applying filter coefficients in between these DFT and IDFT crossbars. This highly scalable new method of filtering leverages advantages found both in conventional digital and analog filters and allows any digital filter to be implemented in the analog domain with a filter order as large as half the utilized crossbar size. The proposed architecture allows for the generation of arbitrary filter functions with tunable corner (or center) frequencies and bandwidths from 0.2-20GHz. Stopband attenuation greater than 40dB is achieved with as low as 2-bit memristor precision, while close to 80dB is possible with 8-bit precision. The filter system consumes 106mW to support the 20GHz frequency range, resulting in a 5.3mW/GHz energy metric.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401275","Analog filter;crossbar;DFT;digital filter;memristor;tunable filter","Wireless communication;Filtering;Discrete Fourier transforms;Memristors;Harmonic analysis;Digital filters;Power harmonic filters","","3","","29","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these queues always require an unused element at all the times to safeguard the front and rear pointers of the queue, so as to avoid data race conditions, which leads to the waste of memory. The waste of memory is especially disadvantageous in applications such as I/O data transfer, and image transfer between processing filters, when large element size is needed, We propose a lock- free solution of the bounded circular queue through read/write atomic operations, but without the need of an extra element in the queue.

Meanwhile, they are compute- and memory-intensive as the deep layers induce massive matrix-multiplication operations. The Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) can naturally carry out the matrix-multiplication in memory. Therefore, ReRAM-based accelerators are widely used for deploying DNN applications. Researchers strive to compress DNNs to accelerate DNNs on the ReRAM-based accelerators. However, the existing works focus on ReRAM-crossbar level compression. Such coarse-grained pruning lacks the flexibility for a higher compression rate. In this paper, we present our ReRAM-Sharing, a softwarehardware co-design scheme, to explore fined-grained weight sharing compression for ReRAM-based accelerators. Due to the limits of ADC bandwidth and ADC numbers, DNN computation on ReRAM crossbars is conducted in a smaller granularity, denoted as Operation Unit (OU). Motivated by this, we propose ReRAM-Sharing algorithm that applies weight-sharing on OU- level to exploit fine-grained sparsity. Our proposed ReRAM- Sharing reduces the redundancy of DNNs while maintaining the representation capability. Moreover, as the ReRAM-Sharing algorithm is orthogonal with the traditional pruning techniques, we can integrate them to shrink NN model size further. We then propose the ReRAM-Sharing architecture, which introduces the index table and adders to the traditional ReRAM-based accelerator, to support the ReRAM-Sharing algorithm. Experiment results show that our proposed ReRAM-Sharing achieves up to 59.39x and 14.47x compression ratio with negligible accuracy loss on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, respectively.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401155","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401155","","Image coding;Resistive RAM;Redundancy;Computer architecture;Hardware;Indexes;Integrated circuit modeling","","1","","19","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper shows that the equalizer parameters found by conventional methods do not necessarily minimize post-FEC BER due to the unaccounted-for negative impact of DFE error propagation on FEC performance. However, the introduction of 1/(1+D) pre-coding eliminates long error bursts so that both pre-FEC and post-FEC BER are minimized with the same equalizer coefficients.

Considering the inherent error resilience of the inference process in machine learning applications, the requirement of error-free communication in the data-path is controversial. In this paper, a custom CNN accelerator integrating a channel emulator is designed by using an FPGA to analyze the effect of the BER of an I/O transceiver on the image classification accuracy. In order to implement a channel emulator, a digital-domain look-up-table (LUT)-based 12-tap FIR filter is employed to create inter-symbol interference (ISI), and a PRBS31 generator is used as a noise source. The implementation was evaluated by running the ImageNet dataset on the FPGA-based custom accelerator (Virtex Ultrascale+) implementing VGG-16.

We propose a hybrid in-memory computing (HIC) architecture for the training of DNNs on hardware accelerators that results in memory-efficient inference and outperforms baseline software accuracy in benchmark tasks. We introduce a weight representation technique that exploits both binary and multi-level phase-change memory (PCM) devices, and this leads to a memory-efficient inference accelerator. Unlike previous in-memory computing- based implementations, we use a low precision weight update accumulator that results in more memory savings. We trained the ResNet-32 network to classify CIFAR-10 images using HIC. For a comparable model size, HIC-based training outperforms baseline network, trained in floating-point 32-bit (FP32) precision, by leveraging appropriate network width multiplier. Furthermore, we observe that HIC-based training results in about 50 % less inference model size to achieve baseline comparable accuracy. We also show that the temporal drift in PCM devices has a negligible effect on post-training inference accuracy for extended periods (year). Finally, our simulations indicate HIC-based training naturally ensures that the number of write-erase cycles seen by the devices is a small fraction of the endurance limit of PCM, demonstrating the feasibility of this architecture for achieving hardware platforms that can learn in the field.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401384","","Training;Phase change materials;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Memory architecture;Hardware;Software","","","","30","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a fault resistant AES with DPA awareness. First, we evaluate the DPA resistance for different implementation architectures of AES before the implementation with S-Box over GF(24)2 is selected. Second, we evaluate the DPA resistance for different fault detection architectures before the concurrent fault detection method is selected.

We have performed tests based on Partial Guessing Entropy (PGE) to evaluate the DPA resistance for the existing DFA-resistant designs and our proposed design. Experimental results prove that our design has a slower convergence speed (around 33%) with a 100% fault coverage rate and less area than the existing countermeasure designs for fault injection.

Proposed HIA is inserted inside mathematical operations of individual layers of CNN, which propagates erroneous operations in all the subsequent CNN layers that leads to misclassification. The attack is non-periodic and completely random, hence it becomes difficult to detect. Five different attack scenarios with respect to each CNN layer are designed and evaluated based on the overhead resources and the rate of triggering in comparison to the original implementation. Our results for two CNN architectures show that in all the attack scenarios, additional latency is negligible (<; 0.61%), increment in DSP, LUT, FF is also less than 2.36%. Three attack scenarios does not require any additional BRAM resources, while in two scenarios BRAM increases, which compensates with the corresponding decrease in FF and LUTs.

In this work, we conduct a statistical analysis to quantify the effect of physical layout on the randomness of multiple copies of the same PUF structure that deployed relatively close on the same FPGA die. As a case study, we have adopted an FPGA-based ring PUF structure known as bistable ring PUF. The results show that only 2 out of the 64 PUFs structure can show good randomness behavior. Even by considering 40%-60% randomness as an acceptable range, only 10 out of 64 PUFs can pass this criterion. Moreover, most of the rest PUFs are extremely biased toward a single state.

The threat of Hardware Trojans (HTs) penetrating complex hardware systems such as multi/many-core processors are increasing due to the increasing presence of third party players in a System-on-chip (SoC) design. Even by deploying naïve HTs, an adversary can exploit the NoC backbone of the processor and get access to communication patterns in the system.

To solve this problem, a new lightweight PUF-based mutual authentication and key-exchange protocol is proposed in this paper to allow two resource-constrained PUF embedded endpoint devices to authenticate each other without the need to store the CRPs locally, and simultaneously establish the session key for secure data exchange without resorting to public-key algorithm. The PUF response reliability is mitigated by the use of reverse fuzzy extractor to offload the compute- intensive error decoding to the server during the initialization phase of the protocol.

To add additional hardware or to utilize cloud computing, we need to solve the cost problem and the reliable communication requirement between vehicles and cloud platform, which is difficult to be applied in a short time. Therefore, we need to propose a short-term solution for automobile manufacturers. In this paper, we propose a signature-based light-weight intrusion detection system, which can be applied directly and promptly to vehicle's ECUs (Electronic Control Units). We detect the anomalies caused by several attack modes on CAN bus from real-world scenarios, which provide the basis for selecting signatures.

The image is constructed through photoacoustic waves emitted from the sample after absorbing light energy. The ultrasound signals are converted into electrical signals by ultrasound transducers and sent to a multi-channel data acquisition (DAQ) system for transmission to the personal computer. Traditionally, one ultrasound signal would occupy one channel of the DAQ. However, high-performance DAQ is awfully expensive. Nowadays, to improve PAT's imaging result, imaging systems with multi-detector is usually required, which means multi-channel DAQ is exceedingly desired. Therefore, in this paper, a 4-to-1 circuit module is proposed to reduce the PAT system's cost by fusing four channels of signals into one signal employing frequency- division multiplexing (FDM). Specifically, the original four PA signals are multiplied with high-frequency sine waves with different frequencies and then summed into one channel so that the signals are carried separately in a bandwidth that does not overlap in the frequency domain. After the modulated signal's acquisition, the original signal can be recovered through bandpass filters and an associated demodulation algorithm. We have performed imaging experiments and proved the feasibility of this module in the PAT system.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401775","photoacoustic tomography;frequency division multiplexing;modulation","Ultrasonic imaging;Frequency-domain analysis;Data acquisition;Tomography;Frequency division multiplexing;Demodulation;Biomedical imaging","","2","","23","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We first prove that the output weight of the S-ELM learnt in a class-incremental manner is as same as that of a regular ELM which prior has the information of the number of total class. Therefore, in our experiment, S-ELM immunes from the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which is a common problem in class-incremental scenarios. Comparing to another class-incremental extreme learning machine such as progressive ELM, S-ELM outperforms progressive ELM by 7% accuracy in online dataset.

This way, the input capacitance can be equally distributed among the two phases, resulting in a 2× reduction in the switched capacitor load that needs to be driven by the input buffer. We further show that doing this also introduces notches in the signal-transfer- function of the modulator at odd-multiples of the sampling frequency, thereby preventing aliasing from those frequencies.

If blindly used at near- and sub-threshold voltages, such libraries exhibit excessively coarse granularity in driving strength, leading to sub-optimal logic synthesis and placement-and- routing results. To tackle this problem, a holistic methodology for designing a near- and sub-threshold standard cell library that has fine driving strength granularity is presented in this paper. Meanwhile, the proposed methodology leverages inverse narrow width effect, reverse short channel effect and forward body biasing to modulate the driving strength at low area overheads. Based on the proposed methodology, we develop a 65nm multi-threshold-voltage, multi-channel-length library and benchmark it against the commercial library across several common circuits. The results show a 26.6% reduction in power-delay product, a 28.1% reduction in energy-delay product, and a 27.0% reduction in leakage power at 5.8% area overhead on average, confirming the efficiency of the methodology in near- and sub-threshold digital circuits design.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401508","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Science Foundation; Catalyst Foundation; Semiconductor Research Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401508","Fine granularity;driving strength;standard cell library;design methodology;ultra-low voltage","Design methodology;Benchmark testing;Libraries;Integrated circuit modeling;Standards;Digital circuits;Physical design","","2","","14","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CRC en/decoding is carried out using linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) and a parallel LFSR can be implemented by registers with a feedback matrix multiplication and an input pre-processing matrix multiplication. A large parallelism is needed to achieve the high throughput required by modern applications. In prior designs, the complexity of parallel LF- SRs has been reduced by applying state transformation and/or modifying the input tap. In this paper, we first show that the input tap modification can be actually described by a category of state transformation. Using this type of transformation, the pre-processing matrix in a highly-parallel LFSR can be simplified without changing the feedback matrix. Additionally, we show that the post-processing matrix multiplication in state-transformed designs can be eliminated without affecting the error detection capability of the CRC. Utilizing these two techniques, the area requirement of highly-parallel CRC can be reduced by 7-16% without increasing the critical path for various parallelisms and most generator polynomials compared to the best previous design.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401679","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401679","Error correction code (ECC);cyclic redundancy check (CRC);linear feedback shift register (LFSR)","Cyclic redundancy check;Linear feedback shift registers;Redundancy;Parallel processing;Throughput;Generators;Complexity theory","","7","","13","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In most of the conventional rectifier analysis, the diodes were modeled as unidirectional ideal switches with a constant threshold voltage. Prior knowledge was needed for specifying the on/off state of a diode in different phases, as well as whether the circuit works under continuous or discontinuous condition modes (CCM or DCM). However, under high-frequency operation, whose frequency might be up to several MHz, the influence of parasitic components, such as the junction capacitor, is more significant. Such a simple ideal switch model and preliminary on/off assignment are not accurate enough to describe the actual switching dynamics. Given this insufficiency, this paper proposes an equivalent impedance analysis and compensation study of full-wave bridge rectifiers based on the extended impedance method (EIM). EIM provides an efficient frequency-domain numeric solution for nonlinear circuit analysis. The steady-state characteristics of a rectifier circuit can be easily and efficiently simulated with EIM, no matter it operates in CCM or DCM, under low or high frequencies. Taking the bridge rectifier in the secondary side of a 6.78MHz wireless power transfer (WPT) system, for example, we demonstrate that EIM can model its dynamics very well. The efficient numeric method is further utilized to optimize the rectifier circuit through impedance compensation towards zero phase angle (ZPA) operation. Both the commercial simulator PSpice and experiment results validate the feasibility of this EIM based analysis and optimization.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401406","","Impedance measurement;Rectifiers;Bridge circuits;Numerical models;Steady-state;Impedance;Integrated circuit modeling","","3","","10","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

All sensing modalities are acquired simultaneously and modulated onto a single waveform using multi-frequency PWM modulation, overcoming the associated transmission overhead. Furthermore, ISFET non-idealities such as trapped charge are compensated through a global DAC, balancing the input linear OTA, while the light sensor dark current is mitigated in-pixel by subtracting its influence using a reference photodiode.

It has been believed that polarization switching occurs due to the transformation in the HfOx layer to a specific crystalline phase through high temperature annealing. Considering the essentially required fabrication process, ferroelectric memory available in various configurations may be thermally stable or need to be demonstrated at as low a temperature as possible. Therefore, in this paper, device design and engineering strategies to improve the polarization switching are addressed. First, the experimental results show that a high pressure annealing technique not only significantly lowers the temperature required for phase transition in the HfOx layer to 550 °C, but also enhances the crystallinity. On the other hand, in a situation where the polarization is utilized to adjust the carrier density of the transistor channel, thermally stabilized ferroelectricity at high temperatures is preferred. A trilayer structure in which thin Al2O3 layer is introduced to improve instability is also discussed.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401627","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401627","ferroelectric memory","Annealing;Zirconium;Switches;Hafnium compounds;Dielectrics;Transistors;Thermal stability","","2","","22","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since quantum computer platforms that are currently available comprise only a few tenths of qubits, as well as the access to a fabricated quantum computer is time limited for the majority of researchers, the use of quantum simulators is essential in developing and testing new quantum algorithms. Taking inspiration from previous work on developing a novel quantum simulator based on memristor crossbar circuits, in this work, a framework that automates the circuit design of emulated quantum gates is presented. The proposed design framework deals with the generation and programming of memristor crossbar configuration that incorporates the desirable quantum circuit, leading to a technology agnostic design tool.

The split-capacitor DAC is shown to be much more sensitive to unit-capacitor mismatch and parasitic capacitances as opposed to the binary-weighted DACs. Unit-capacitor values are then calculated for the split-capacitor and binary-weighted DAC topologies under two orthogonal scenarios: (a) Fixed linearity at the expense of the area and power consumption and (b) Maximizing the linearity within a specified area budget. In-spite of requiring significantly lower number of unit elements as compared to a binary-weighted DAC, split-capacitor DAC yields a larger value of unit-capacitor and total DAC capacitance for fixed linearity scenario and conversely results in a lower effective number of bits (ENOB) for a fixed area specification.

These bulky pull-up devices and scan-flops make it hard to integrate along-side a memory array in an area-efficient manner. Further, it is prone to error due to local variations owing to limited digital control. In this paper, we propose an area-efficient, Word-Line (WL) pitch-aligned, layout friendly In-Memory compatible DAC (IM-DAC), whose layout resembles the 8T SRAM array very closely, thus achieving memory array-like density. Simulation results show that the worst-case INL and DNL is 2.42 LSB and -0.32 LSB, respectively. We obtained a 3.4X area advantage in comparison with the conventional DAC.

Although multi-context scrubbing operations can treat permanent failure issues on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), implementing sequential circuits is difficult because the flip-flop location must be changed while maintaining sequential operations. Therefore, no multi-context scrubbing operation including a sequential circuit has been demonstrated to date. As described herein, a multi-context scrubbing operation using a simple 8-bit counter circuit has been demonstrated perfectly on an Artix-7 FPGA (XC7A35TICSG324-1L).

These architectures rely on high-performance communication links between the base stations and the central computing systems.

To reduce system complexity and energy consumption, 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are leveraged with the cost of lowering the signal quality. To recover the lost information, more sophisticated algorithms, like Joint Channel-and-Data (JCD) estimation, are required whose computation demand is a barrier toward practical implementation. In this paper, we suggest modifications to the current state-of-the-art JCD estimation algorithm to enhance its performance and ease the implementation costs. The modified algorithm delivers up to 4 dB higher symbol error rate in high SNR cases. This improvement is based on a new initialization strategy and an efficient exit condition with lower computation time. We implemented the proposed algorithm on a GPU accelerated system with higher throughput compared to the vanilla BiG-AMP algorithm suitable for software-defined radio systems.

Deploying ASICs at the tip of the catheter is challenging, as power is delivered through a long and thin wire, limiting the power integrity. Also, since the catheter needs to fit into the diameter of a blood vessel or other narrow channel in the human body, there is no room for bulky decoupling capacitors. Finally, power consumption must be optimized, as the energy density may lead to prohibitive heating of tissues and fluids. Still, while targeting better performance, e.g. higher imaging resolution, the requirements for bandwidth and accuracy consistently increase, ultimately demanding precise on-chip clock generation for communication and digitization. In this paper we propose a circuit for at-the-tip clock generation in smart catheters, comprising a low-drop out (LDO) regulator, voltage and current references and a low-jitter digitally controlled oscillator (DCO). The clock generator also comprises a clock divider with programmable duty cycle, allowing system reconfiguration. The circuit is laid out and simulated under application conditions. The LDO achieves a full-spectrum power supply ripple rejection (PSRR) of 50 dB with an output load of 10 mA. The DCO, supplied by the aforementioned LDO, achieves a phase noise of -104.5 dBc/Hz at an offset of 1 MHz and 1.25 GHz of oscillating frequency. The proposed clock generator allows digitization at 200 MSps with a maximum SNR of 56.3 dB for an input signal of 50 MHz if phase noise is integrated from 100 kHz to 625 MHz.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401640","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401640","","Phase noise;Capacitors;Generators;System-on-chip;Catheters;Clocks;Signal to noise ratio","","","","11","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When it comes to realize the hardware implementation of a large-scale Neural network for mobile applications, area and power consumption constraints become more critical. Optimizing Spiking neural network, constituting of neuron and synapse circuits, for area and power is essential. In this paper we present a more optimized version of Synapse and neuron circuits. We propose an analog CMOS implementation of a current multiplier charge injector-based Synapse and neuron circuit. The synapse circuit modulates the input spike rates by a trained weight value and injects an equivalent current. The neuron circuit integrates the injected synaptic current and evokes an output digital spike event. The circuit implementation is done using 65nm process design kit. The proposed circuit implementation exhibits all the temporal characteristics of Spiking neural networks. The circuit implementation has been optimized for area and power consumption and therefore can be easily constituted into a large-scale spiking neural network. Furthermore, the compact circuit implementation can benefit from the high resolution with very less increase in area and power.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401173","Image classification;CMOS","Process design;Power demand;Neurons;Hardware;Mobile applications;Biological neural networks;Synapses","","5","","19","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, we proposed a neural recording system which detects neural spikes directly on the signals collected from electrophysiological probes. The system achieves power efficiency by utilising a combination of integrative sensing and ultra-fine offset compensation. A central component of this design is a memristive load, which is utilised as a trimming device along the differential branches of the core amplifier, ultimately allowing system offset tuning with μν precision. Previous work has assumed that the memristive device features a linear, or nearly-linear current-voltage (IV) characteristic. In this paper, we study the impact of memristor IV non-linearity on the effective gain and offset compensation capability of the system. Results show that the non-linearity experimentally measured from our in-house metal-oxide memristor technology only induces a small gap between nominal resistive state and static RS (as reflected on the IV). This leads to a very small degradation of gain (≈ 2.5%) and offset compensation (≈ 50% increased offset tuning sensitivity), but very crucially proves that introducing IV non-linearity does not materially change either the extreme offset trimming precision or the overall performance. This was the last conceptual bottleneck identified before practical implementation and it has now been overcome.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401123","","Degradation;Sensitivity;Memristors;Sensors;Probes;Tuning;Edge computing","","3","","10","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these techniques may incur significant design overhead, and methods that can mitigate the implementation cost for a given security level are desirable. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing an algorithm for deciding the location and inputs of the LUTs in LUT-based obfuscation to enhance security and reduce design overhead.

This paper presents the design and analysis of the EM side-channel attack detection system utilizing patterned-ground co-planar capacitive asymmetry sensing (PG-CAS) for approaching probe, targeting to improve sensitivity, detection range, and power consumption compared to LC oscillator utilizing inductive sensing. The PG-CAS consists of a grid of four metal plates of the same size at the top metal layer and a patterned ground plane at a lower metal. As an EM probe approaches, electric field lines between the plates and plate-ground get distorted, thereby breaking the symmetry of the inter-plate and the plate-ground capacitance system and this change in capacitance is sensed. The PG-CAS circuit consists of two LC oscillators, mixer, low pass filter (LPF), resistive feedback amplifier (RFA) and a digital logic. By down-converting sensing signal to low-frequency using mixer, LPF, RFA and digital logic, the detection range is significantly improved. At a distance of 1 mm between the sensing metal plates and the approaching EM probe, system-level simulation results using TSMC 65nm technology and Ansys Maxwell show a > 10% change in the output frequency from the baseline frequency, leading to a > 10× improvement in the detection range and a ~ 3× improvement in power consumption over existing inductive sensing methods.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401580","National Science Foundation; Intel Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401580","inductive sensing;micro EM probe","Metals;Side-channel attacks;Capacitance;Sensors;Probes;Oscillators;Mixers","","7","","16","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By relocating the inductor at the output, which is the lower current path, the conduction loss on the inductor can be significantly reduced. The right half plane zero (RHPZ) in the control-to-output transfer function can also be eliminated; therefore, a simple pulse-width modulation (PWM) voltage-mode controller can be used for the proposed DI-HBOC while still achieving high closed-loop bandwidth and fast transient response.

The key to reducing inference times without drastic decreases in accuracy is allocating optimal bit widths according to each layer or filter. One of the most promising ways to find optimal bit allocations is to learn quantization step size and weight parameters through gradient descent. The conventional method optimizes those parameters under the constraint for model size or memory footprint of CNN. However, the bit allocations obtained by the conventional method are not always optimal for inference time because the arithmetic intensity of CNN is significantly high, and the time spent on computing is a bottleneck for the inference time. In this paper, we propose a regularization method using a computational-complexity metric (which we call MACxbit) that is correlated with the inference time of quantized CNN models. The proposed method can obtain an optimal bit allocation that achieves better recognition accuracy under a specified computational-complexity target than the conventional method. For similar recognition accuracy on the optimized ResNet-18 model, the proposed method achieves 21.0% less inference time compared to the conventional method.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401657","CNN;quantization;mixed-precision computing","Measurement;Adaptation models;Quantization (signal);Target recognition;Computational modeling;Bit rate;Integrated circuit modeling","","8","","26","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of metamaterials in wireless applications is becoming widespread due to its extraordinary properties such as evanescent wave amplification and negative refractive index. This paper studies a soft, flexible and stretchable Complementary Split Ring Resonator (CSRR) metamaterial energy harvester using a volume of 5.6 x 5.6 x 1 mm3 on a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. The CSRR is backed by a ground plane to absorb the incident power, and a via (load) is used to maximize the power harvesting efficiency. For stretchability, a typically rigid patch of the CSRR is replaced by the serpentine mesh. From the ANSYS HFSS simulation, it is found that the serpentine structure helps to reduce the size of the CSRR due to an increase in electrical length. The structure can also achieve high-quality factor (Q-factor), thereby enabling almost unity efficiency.

In the proposed HB-TX, coarse polar modulation is realized by combining the main DPA and a low-bit selector, while a fine quadrature modulation is realized by the asymmetrical quadrature recombination of main and auxiliary DPAs in a small range. Through coarse and fine modulation, the HB-TX realizes fast signal modulation and does not require high-speed and high-resolution phase modulator. With the coarse polar modulation, the HB-TX achieves high efficiency which is close to that of polar transmitter and no longer suffers from 3 dB back-off. Since the asymmetry of two-path DPA arrays improves the isolation between two channels, local oscillators (LOs) with 50% duty cycle is employed to further improve the HB-TX's efficiency. Simulation results show that the HB-TX with a 4-bit selector achieves 23.7-dBm peak output power with 39.2% peak power added efficiency (PAE). When modulating a 64-QAM signal with 80-Msym/s symbol rate and 6.5-dB peak average power rate (PAPR), the HB-TX improves the average drain efficiency from 16.3% (achieved in quadrature transmitter) to 22.2% The average output power that is delivered by the HB-TX is 17.6-dBm with 17.4% average PAE, while the error vector magnitude (EVM) is -35.87 dB.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401069","Polar;Quadrature;Power Amplifier;Coarse Modulation;Fine Modulation","Phase modulation;Auxiliary transmitters;Simulation;Power amplifiers;Peak to average power ratio;Power generation;Tuning","","","","12","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, a process scalable architecture for low noise figure impedance matched sub-sampling mixer-first RF front-end is proposed addressing the issues of noise folding and impedance matching with process scalable circuit components like switches, capacitors and inverters. A scheme to reject the selected IF odd-harmonics of fs/4 by multi-path sampling is proposed, alleviating the effect of noise folding and leading to low noise figure sub-sampling mixer-first RF front-end. The combination of the complex impedance band-pass filter along with the IF-LNA provide the tuned impedance matching. In addition, analysis on sub-sampling frequency plan, amount of harmonic rejection and its effect on noise figure, transparency of the impedance at the RF port and its tunability with respect to the input impedance of IF-LNA is presented. To validate the analysis and modeling, as well as to explain the architecture, an example low-power narrow-band IoT(NB-IoT) standard RF front-end is realized in 1.2 V, 65 nm CMOS and it is observed that the performance predicted by analytical equations is in agreement with Spectre RF simulations.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401387","mixer-first RF;low noise figure","Radio frequency;Semiconductor device modeling;Noise figure;Impedance matching;Mathematical model;Impedance;Mixers","","3","","14","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, in order to dynamically allocate wireless channels to the WIs based on their traffic demands, a dynamic and traffic-aware MAC mechanism is required. In this paper, we design a traffic demand predictor for each WI based on its current and history traffic conditions. According to the predicted demands, we are able to allocate access to wireless channels dynamically and switch between two kinds of time division based MAC mechanisms. Simulations under various conditions indicate that the average delay decreases by 30% and 20% on average compared with a traditional MAC mechanism and an existing dynamic time division based one, respectively.

Since, by overwhelming the NoC, the system is unable to forward legitimate traffic. However, the effectiveness of FDoS attacks depend on the NoC configuration. Moreover, designing a secure MPSoC capable of detecting such attacks while avoiding excessive power/energy and area costs is challenging. To this end, we present two contributions. First, we demonstrate two types of FDoS attacks: based on the packet injection rate (PIR-based FDoS) and based on the packet's payload length (PPL-based FDoS). We show that fair round-robin NoCs are intrinsically protected against PIR-based FDoS. Instead, PPL-based FDoS attacks represent a real threat to MPSoCs.

Congestion hampers system performance because of the delay in packet delivery, which in turn results in reduced effective utilization of resources and reduced throughout. Higher congestion also results in higher energy consumption in NoC as packets spend more time in the network. Reactive detection and/or a single fixed routing algorithm are not effective to prevent congestion from happening for different traffic patterns in NoC. Therefore, we propose reinforcement learning based proactive routing technique that selects the best routing algorithm from multiple available routing algorithms using NoC utilization and congestion information to improve communication performance.

The underlying challenge is to understand the hidden patterns in the sequence by means of analyzing short- and long-term dependencies and temporal differences. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are widely used in problem domains like speech recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), fault prediction, and language translation modeling over the past few years. Higher accuracy demands complex LSTM network models which lead to high computational cost, area overhead, and excessive power consumption. Reversible logic circuit synthesis, in the context of ideally Zero heat dissipation, has emerged as a new research paradigm for low power circuit designs. In this paper, we have proposed a novel design of LSTM architecture using reversible logic gates. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first attempt to implement a complete feedforward LSTM circuit using only reversible logic gates. The hardware implementation of the proposed method is presented using VHDL and Altera Arria10 GX FPGA.

As they often rely on a significant number of multiply-and-accumulate cells, it is crucial to optimize their area and cost. Recently, a 3D Nanofabric flow has been proposed, where logic circuits are designed by stacking N identical vertical tiers on top of each other. Exploiting identical layers allows a fabrication process similar to the Vertical-NAND flash, where all the layers can be patterned at once. While the 3D Nanofabric flow presents several layout constraints (single metal routing and identical vertical layers), it can decrease the area by around one order of magnitude, leading to area-efficient and cost-effective circuits. In this paper, we propose to use the 3D Nanofabric process flow to design low-area multipliers. As multipliers can be designed using a regular array organization, we show how they can be spread across multiple vertical layers using the 3D Nanofabric flow, while respecting the different layout constraints. We then provide thorough circuit-level evaluations, including parasitics, to showcase the benefits of our proposed 3D multipliers at the circuit-level. We show that by stacking up to 64 layers to build a 64-input bit multiplier, the area and area-delay- product can be decreased by 28.6x and 25.5x, respectively, compared to a traditional 2D implementation using a 28nm FDSOI technology, with only a 10% and 35% delay and power consumption overheads, respectively.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401685","","Three-dimensional displays;Power demand;Stacking;Layout;Silicon-on-insulator;Routing;Delays","","2","","27","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, effectively using these two modalities of data has the potential to improve the disease screening process. We evaluate this hypothesis on a subset of the PhysioNet Challenge 2016 Dataset which contains simultaneously acquired PCG and ECG recordings. Our novel dual-convolutional neural network based approach uses transfer learning to tackle the problem of having limited amounts of simultaneous PCG and ECG data that is publicly available, while having the potential to adapt to larger datasets.

In the current state-of-the-art techniques, recycled ICs are detected by measuring the frequency, current, path delay or power-up values to estimate the HCI, BTI and EM effects on the transistors with age. Some of the state- of-the-art techniques require additional on-chip sensors to detect and estimate the age of an IC while others use existing logic like SRAM and Flip-flops to detect the recycled ICs. In this paper, we provide a methodology to detect a recycled IC and also to estimate its age by using the existing IO pad structures. For the first time, age is estimated by measuring voltage drop across the protection diodes present in IO pad structure. With this methodology, no additional sensors have to be added and hence there is no area overhead. With this proposed methodology, ICs that are used for a minimum period of a day can be effectively detected by using the concept of extended Kalman filtering technique for the first time in this domain. By stressing the part for five days, our proposed methodology can estimate the age of the IC aged between 1 month to 5 years with 95% percent of accuracy.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401363","Counterfeit;Aging;Recycled ICs;Diode;Input- Output(IO) pad;protection diodes;Kalman Filter;Non Volatile Memory(NVM);Original Chip Manufacturer(OCM)","Integrated circuits;Voltage measurement;Writing;Time measurement;Sensors;Kalman filters;Transistors","","3","","26","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many studies focused on modeling the biological encoding part that translates the spatial frequency into a temporal spiking frequency, but few explored the decoding part. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on a spiking neural network able to detect the frequency of an input signal. Inspired by biological evidence, our architecture detects the range in which the encoded frequency dwells and could therefore decode the texture's spatial period.

Nevertheless, a large list size or stack depth will lead to high computational complexities and hardware resources. To this end, successive cancellation priority (SCP) decoding with priority- first searching strategy and trellis-like storage is proposed to offer one solution. In this paper, an efficient SCP decoder is first proposed to verify its advantages over SCL and SCS decoders. Furthermore, an adaptive node-inserting scheme is proposed to reduce the number of bits insert into the priority queue. Numerical results have shown that for the polar code with transmission length 1024 and rate 1/2, the proposed adaptive SCP (ASCP) decoder can achieve significant time complexity reduction on average compared with the standard SCL decoder. The hardware architecture of SCP decoding is implemented using 65-nm CMOS technology and the results show better throughput compared with the SCS decoder.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401175","Polar codes;successive cancellation priority decoding;adaptive;5G;hardware implementation","Technological innovation;Computer architecture;Throughput;Hardware;Decoding;Polar codes;Time complexity","","2","","20","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve the quality of the compressed image while keeping the same bit-rate, decoder-side compression artifacts reduction (CAR) becomes important. Recently, convolutional neural networks are adopted for CAR tasks and achieve the state-of-the-art performance. However, most CAR algorithms only focus on the reconstruction of the luminance channel. Also, a separate model usually needs to be trained for each quality factor (QF), which makes these approaches not practical in existing codecs. In this paper, we analyze a quality-blind training strategy and compare it with training separate models for each QF. The testing results with three representative CAR algorithms show the superiority of the quality-blind training compared to separate training. The results for pseudo and real quality-blind CAR tests further prove the generalizability of the quality-blind training for practical CAR tasks.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401182","compression artifacts reduction;post-filtering;quality-blind enhancement;convolutional neural networks","Training;Analytical models;Image coding;Codecs;Automobiles;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis","","","","23","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some challenges still remain such as computational complexity that prevent the practical application of learning-based codecs. In this paper, we address the issue of heavy time complexity from the view of arithmetic coding. Prevalent learning-based image compression scheme first maps the natural image into latent representations and then conduct arithmetic coding on quantized latent maps. Previous arithmetic coding schemes define the start and end value of the arithmetic codebook as the minimum and maximum of the whole latent maps, ignoring the fact that the value ranges in most channels are shorter. Hence, we propose to use a channel-adaptive codebook to accelerate arithmetic coding. We find that the latent channels have different frequency-related characteristics, which are verified by experiments of neural frequency filtering. Further, the value ranges of latent maps are different across channels which are relatively image-independent. The channel-adaptive characteristics allow us to establish efficient prior codebooks that cover more appropriate ranges to reduce the runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that both the arithmetic encoding and decoding can be accelerated while preserving the rate-distortion performance of compression model.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401277","Image Compression;Channel-adaptive;Frequency Characteristics;Fast Coding","Image coding;Runtime;Filtering;Rate-distortion;Acceleration;Integrated circuit modeling;Time complexity","","7","","18","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposed a new architecture that matches the current sources of the front-end and delay cells in the RTDC. Therefore, the front-end and RTDC have the same PVT response, leading to an inherent-PVT-stabilized feature. The proposed CDC was implemented in a 40-nm LP CMOS process.

It is based on the observation that each path in a two-path filter averages one half-cycle of the input carrier. If the carrier and the filter's clocks have same frequencies, the average over half-cycle of a sinusoid depends on the phase difference between the clock and the input. A 90o or 270o phase difference can result in a zero average, and potentially a perfect carrier suppression. Since this principle of blocker suppression is based on a relative phase relationship between the clock and the blocker, and not a relative frequency separation between the bands, it is shown to break the trade-offs plaguing the pass-band width of a filter and the extent of close-in blocker suppression. A digitally auto-tuned loop that calibrates the 2-path clocks to the desired phase is proposed. The proposed two-path architecture is shown to attenuate close- in blockers more efficiently than the traditional bandpass and bandstop N-path filters.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401459","","Band-pass filters;Time-frequency analysis;Receivers;Switches;Attenuation;Standards;Clocks","","","","7","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both have the potential to radically change how technology influences us. However, since edge devices feature only very limited resources, the sheer amount of performance required by modern NNs limits their use on the edge. Especially, the conversion of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) into feasible on-chip designs remains a hard task. Currently, hand-crafted and most-often very heavy architectures have to be used as existing High-Level Synthesis (HLS) frameworks provide only inefficient solutions. In this paper, we introduce the Crossbar Neural Network (XbNN) architecture. Our architecture employs a novel approximate on-chip dot product encoding for the efficient synthesis of CNNs on hardware. This encoding embeds the weights used in CNNs into the hardware design itself, significantly reducing the required memory and computation time. In addition, we present a methodology for the automated conversion of traditional CNNs given in TensorFlow into accelerators on top of the XbNN architecture. To demonstrate the effectiveness of XbNN, we conduct experiments on a common CNN test dataset and analyze the accuracy and performance of the resulting XbNN accelerators. We show that XbNN (a) achieves similar accuracies compared to TensorFlow CNNs and (b) provides much better area and performance results in comparison to a state-of-the-art HLS flow.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401780","","Performance evaluation;Memory management;Computer architecture;Encoding;Hardware;System-on-chip;Task analysis","","4","","30","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While FP16 is acknowledged for its advantage of high computation and memory efficiencies for training DNN, the training must be accompanied with techniques dedicated for a particular dataset. Therefore, a hardware engine with a configurable bit-width feature is desirable for covering any datasets and applications. This work proposes an adaptive bit-width and voltage scaling (ABVS) scheme for DNN training. The key idea is to increase fraction bit-width (FB) gradually from a small value according to current training quality (e.g., accuracy, mAP). Since less FB achieves shorter hardware latency, this training scheme concurrently adapts bit-width and voltage scaling and intensify energy reduction. Experimental results show that the ABVS scheme achieves the comparable quality to FP32 with at most 0.5% accuracy drop, but up to 63% energy reduction.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401556","deep learning training;floating-point;configurable bit-width;bit-width scaling;voltage scaling","Training;Deep learning;Energy consumption;Memory management;Hardware;Computational efficiency;Engines","","","","23","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially for multi-valued PUFs it is of importance to decrease RO frequency errors before digitization. Otherwise, these errors can result in a huge amount of bit-flips. To counteract environmental influence in the reproduction phase, we propose to map a frequency, which might be remeasured under a temperature condition different from initialization, closer to the initial frequency by using a method based on polynomial interpolation.

Currently, the detection of dementia is mainly achieved using questionnaire-like neuropsychological tests. Such ways usually cost a lot of time. To this end, we design a contactless dementia detection system based on gait analysis from surveillance video, and it can serve as a home-based healthcare system. This system applies a Kinect 2.0 camera to capture the human video and extract the skeleton joints at a rate of 15 frames per second.

However, due to the high dense neuron computing, the power issue becomes the design challenge of the ANN hardware implementation. On the other hand, the Stochastic Computing (SC) method has been proven as an efficient way to substitute the high-power arithmetic unit through stochastic bit-stream- based computing. Therefore, many SC-based ANN designs were proposed in recent years. However, due to the stochastic bitstream computing, the conventional SC-based ANN designs suffer from low computing accuracy. In this work, we apply the Extended Stochastic Logic (ESL) method to solve the accuracy problem of the conventional SC-based ANN designs. Because the ESL method supports a wider input coding range for the SC process, the computing accuracy can be improved. With this design concept, we propose an ESL-based adder to substitute the accumulation process in ANN computing. Furthermore, an ESL-based ReLU function is proposed to be used as the involved activation function instead. Compared with the conventional SC-based approaches, the proposed ESL-based ANN approach can help to improve the system accuracy by 48%.

The second objective is to replace the active devices (mainly VCCS) in circuits with nullors, and prepare them for a smooth application of the AM. The method is replacing the well-known 2-graph methodology, and it is ideal for symbolic representation of circuits, especially for low component density. The core of the AM technique is based on parallel and series (P/S) operations that continuously combines the components until it is reduced to a single element. In case the P/S operations are exhausted but the circuit is still not a single element, we leave the P/S and remove as many elements from the circuit to regenerate new P/S operations. We continue it until the circuit terminates with a single element. It is shown that the admittance of the final element represents a port transfer function (admittance) with the numerator being the determinant of the Nodal Admittance Matrix (NAM).

As a result, a new number format called posit was proposed. As in a variety of number systems, multiplication in posit arithmetic is one of the most frequently used but expensive operations. To reduce the number of hardware resources in a posit multiplier, this paper applies an iterative approach to posit multiplication. To exploit the features of the posit format, the number of truncated bits in the fraction component is dynamically changed depending on the number of regime bits. In addition, architectures for fast parser and packer are proposed. Thanks to the posit format, the proposed design supports about 60 decades wider dynamic range than a single-precision FP multiplier design. Using the iterative approach, the proposed design also reduces the number of lookup tables used in a previous exact posit multiplier design by 44% while achieving a 51% higher maximum frequency, and the appropriate balance between latency and accuracy can be finely determined at runtime.

Part of the decoder is in idle if the length of codeword is not the maximum. A reconfigurable cyclic shifter is a key element of a QC-LDPC decoder. If the shifter can only shift one input at a time, the QC- LDPC decoder can only decode one codeword at a time as well. A segmented reconfigurable cyclic shifter is proposed in this paper to enable a QC-LDPC decoder to parallelly decode multiple codewords. The proposed shifter can be reconfigured into multiple segments of different sizes. Each segment can perform a cyclic shift of different shift values independently. Therefore, the proposed shifter can enhance the QC-LDPC decoder to decode multiple codewords parallelly by inputting another codeword (or codewords) to re-activate the idle hardware. The test chip of QC- LDPC decoder with the proposed segmented reconfigurable cyclic shifter has been fabricated in 0.18μ CMOS technology which can parallelly decode six codewords.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401118","5G;segmented cyclic shifter;codeword-parallel QC-LDPC decoder","5G mobile communication;WiMAX;CMOS technology;Hardware;Decoding;Standards;Wireless fidelity","","1","","11","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such PCDSA is based on the conventional CMOS technology and its sensing result is prone to be affected by the single event upset (SEU) and even the single event double node upset (SEDU) when the CMOS technology node shrinks into the nanometer scale. In this paper, we propose a novel PCDSA to tolerate the SEDU, in which the special three-input C-element that behaves as an inverter when its inputs have the same logic value and holds its previous value when its inputs have the different logic values is employed. By using a physics-based STT-MTJ compact model and a commercial CMOS 40 nm design kit, hybrid simulations have been performed to demonstrate its functionality and evaluate its performance. Simulation results show that it can fully tolerate the SEDU when the amount of the deposited charge (Qinj) reaches up to 2 pC. In the worst case where the Qinj is 2 pC, it can achieve a small recover time of 1.3368 ns and low recover energy dissipation of 1.967 pJ with the optimized VDD of 1 V.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401294","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401294","magnetic random access memory (MRAM);precharge differential sense amplifier (PCDSA);single event upset (SEU);single event double node upset (SEDU);three-input C-element;STT-MTJ;recover time;recover energy dissipation","Semiconductor device modeling;Simulation;Energy dissipation;Random access memory;Single event upsets;Sensors;Magnetic circuits","","10","","17","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We observe an 88.62 to 94.76 % reduction in the average coercive voltage (Vc) of the proposed OFEGS, which is still a significant challenge for the conventional ferroelectric (FE) lead zirconate titanate. We study the resistor-OFEGS (RCofe) series network behaviors in response to a bipolar and unipolar triangular signal. Our findings prove that the presence of NCS is directly correlated with the FE polarization (FEP) switching and not because of any extrinsic defects in the system. The various impacts of Vs, GLK parameters, R, dipole switching resistivity (Rofe) variations on the NCS response are investigated. The proposed OFEGS can harness the NCS effect at ±0.5 V with minimum energy dissipation of 4.81 × 10-16 J, a challenge for the oxide FE-based gate stacks. Calibrating R to the maximum limit, we can capture the S-shaped ideal Landau path where the NCS is maximum with a small deviation of about ±0.006 V at zero FEP. Finally, an OFEGS based Landau transistor is implemented, providing a minimum subthreshold swing (SSmin) of 38.21 mV/decade, which is 36.32 % lesser than the fundamental SSmin limitation of 60 mV/decade. Therefore, the proposed OFEGS with a minimum Vs and remanent polarization (Pr =3D 1.244 μC/cm2) could be used as a gate stack for designing sub-60 mV/decade transistor technology.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401100","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401100","Ferroelectric;landau transistor;negative capacitance;organic ferroelectric;polarization switching","Switches;Logic gates;Capacitance;Iron;Transistors;Titanium compounds;Transient analysis","","3","","18","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various logical and circuit-level countermeasures propose security, but they all come with different power, performance, and area overhead. Besides countermeasures cannot guarantee security, if the adversaries have enough time and computing power in hacking. Thus, highly accurate, real-time attack detection techniques are needed. This paper proposes a switched-capacitor circuit that can detect power SCAs by intrusion detection of a current sense resistor in the external power supply line. A pulsed current is pulled on the supply line to introduce a voltage difference proportional to the IR drop. This IR drop is then amplified through a parasitic- insensitive switched-capacitor amplifier and compared against a pre-determined threshold. The circuit achieved a 4.01us typical detection time and better than 72% accuracy, consuming 2.97 mW in 65-nm CMOS. This work is the first mixed-signal IC implementation for power SCA detection.

Digital as well as mixed-signal architectures have been proposed for self- interference cancellation. In this work we present a digitally intensive mixed-signal approach, where a low-cost auxiliary receiver senses the leaked Tx-signal. Firstly, the sensed signal is used to adaptively estimate the leakage channel, whereas in a second step a cleaned version of the leaked Tx-signal is reconstructed digitally. This reconstructed Tx-leakage signal is then used as input for a low complex adaptive interference cancellation unit to suppress modulated spurs or intermodulation distortions. We show that this approach allows to significantly relax the analog auxiliary receiver specifications, while different to conventional all-digital solutions being able to deal with multiple different types of SI with minimal configuration overhead.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401650","4G;5G;Self-Interference Cancellation","Intermodulation distortion;Interference cancellation;Receivers;Mobile communication;Frequency conversion;Transceivers;Hybrid power systems","","1","","12","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is the contemporary process of detecting the occupancy of spectrum by licensed users in CRN. It outperforms the conventional stand-alone spectrum-sensing (SSS) algorithms. However, such CSS algorithms have higher implementation-complexity than SSS algorithms, resulting in higher resource utilization and alleviating the hardware efficiency. Our work focuses on the design of hardware efficient VLSI-architecture for such CSS algorithms. Specifically, this paper proposes reconfigurable VLSI-architecture of cooperative spectrum sensor (CSR) for both maximum-minimum eigenvalue (MME) and maximum eigenvalue (MED) based CSS algorithms for the data-fusion based CRN. This CSR architecture has been designed based on iterative and shift power-methods to compute maximum and minimum eigenvalues in MME and MED CSS-algorithms. The proposed reconfigurable-CSR is fabricated in UMC 130-nm CMOS process and it has a die dimension of h × w =3D 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm. Furthermore, this work presents the analysis of hardware-complexity, sensing-time and performance with the increasing number of secondary users (or antenna array of CSR) in CRN. Eventually, the fabricated ASIC chip of CSR has been tested and verified in a real-world test environment.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401570","Cognitive radio;spectrum sensing;eigenvalue;VLSI architectures;ASIC design and fabrication","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Hardware;Sensors;Cognitive radio;Resource management;Cascading style sheets;Antenna arrays","","7","","13","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, recently proposed model extraction attacks and reverse engineering techniques make model theft possible and similar quality deep learning solution reproducible at a low cost. To protect the interest and revenue of the model owner, watermarking on Deep Neural Network (DNN) has been proposed. However, the extra components and computations due to the embedded watermark tend to interfere with the model training process and result in inevitable degradation in classification accuracy. In this paper, we utilize the geometry characteristics inherited in the DeepFool algorithm to extract data points near the classification boundary of the target model for ownership verification. As the fingerprint is extracted after the training process has been completed, the original achievable classification accuracy will not be compromised. This countermeasure is founded on the hypothesis that different models possess different classification boundaries determined solely by the hyperparameters of the DNN and the training it has undergone. Therefore, given a set of fingerprint data points, a pirated model or its post-processed version will produce similar prediction but another originally designed and trained DNN for the same task will produce very different prediction even if they have similar or better classification accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed Intellectual Property (IP) protection method is validated on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets. The results show a detection rate of 100% and a false positive rate of 0% for each dataset. More importantly, the fingerprint extraction and its run time are both dataset independent. It is on average ~130× faster than two state-of-the-art fingerprinting methods.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401119","","Training;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Watermarking;Intellectual property;Fingerprint recognition","","21","","19","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most existing DRAM-based TRNGs produce random numbers with either hardware overhead, or low throughput. In this work, we report a novel high dense, high throughput and high entropy DRAM-based TRNG, named DTRNG, that exploits the process variations inherited by the DRAM cell's access transistor and sense amplifiers. DTRNG can be employed in commodity DRAM chips with no hardware overhead and using the standard memory controller commands. The proposed method is based on controlling the word line voltage supply part of the DRAM chip during random number mode. The novel approach provided in this work has been validated using cadence circuit tools on a constructed 8x8 DRAM chip in 65nm technology. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations are performed to verify the entropy of the generated numbers.

System-level simulation results show that the proposed BNN processor can achieve a 3.32* speedup and 11.9* improvement in throughput and energy efficiency, which could be attributed to the device and mapping method co-design.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401356","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401356","Binary Neural Network;Hybrid Spin/CMOS Cell;Time-division Weight Mapping Method;Spintronic Memory","Three-dimensional displays;Nonvolatile memory;Throughput;Energy efficiency;Arrays;Task analysis;Engines","","","","22","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a new methodology called Quantum Automated Synthesizer (QUASH) that can automatically synthesize quantum circuits using decision procedures that perform symbolic reasoning for combinatorial search. Our automated synthesis approach constructs finite symbolic abstract models of the quantum gates automatically and discovers a quantum circuit as a composition of quantum gates using these symbolic models. Our key insight is that most current quantum algorithms work on a finite number of classical inputs, and hence, their correctness proof relies only on reasoning about a finite set of quantum states that can be represented using finite symbolic systems. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by automatically synthesizing four quantum circuits and re-discovering the Bernstein-Vazirani quantum algorithm using state-of-the-art decision procedures. Our synthesis approach only requires distinguishing between a finite set of symbolic quantum states; for example, the synthesis of the Bernstein-Vazirani quantum algorithm only requires reasoning about the following qubit states: |0, |1, -i|0, i|1, |+, |-, e1/2|1i, eiπ/4|1 and a remaining symbolic state representing all other possible quantum states.

Moreover, at each step, a working reference is set up to enable cross-checks in case of any unexpected problem. The guidelines are illustrated with a case study from our own work in which an Arduino prototype has been successfully transformed into a wearable with an extremely small footprint.

Current trends in industry include an increasing demand for engineers who can build FPGA systems. FPGAs, just like other chips, continue to improve in terms of complexity, speed, available resources, and new features. The design complexity for using an FPGA continues to grow and Hardware Description Languages (HDLs), though a step up in design efficiency compared to schematic design, is a low-level approach akin to assembly language for programmers, and HDLs limits the productivity of an engineer. HLS tools, such as Legup, Intel HLS, and Xilinx's Vivado attempt to provide designers with a higher-level design abstraction providing a means to describe their computation in high-level languages - such as C. As these tools become more mainstream in industry, when should education follow? In this work, we explore how HLS tools might be used by an undergraduate by looking at exemplar designs, a simple RISC-V processor and a basic C loop, and implementing the design in both HDL and HLS. We then analyze the FPGA cost of each implementation. Next, we provide a philosophical discussion based on this experience on what the pros and cons of moving students to HLS design abstraction level are.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401774","","Industries;Digital systems;Education;Tools;Complexity theory;Hardware design languages;Field programmable gate arrays","","2","","27","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To alleviate the performance degradation, we propose TCP-Net, an efficient architecture to minimize the number of operations in BNN inference while maintaining the original accuracy. Inspired by the observation that the processes of obtaining the outputs of multiple related kernels in BNNs contain significant repeated calculations, we first build a formula to bridge these outputs by utilizing the kernel inclusion similarity and eliminate the unnecessary operations. Through the recursive algorithm, we further convert each original XNOR-popcount convolution into threshold-comparable-popcount (TCP) operations, which can be implemented to directly achieve the final output without any extra steps. Furthermore, we reduce the remaining TCP operation counts by exploiting tile-based pruning strategy.

It is for these benefits that it would be desirable to implement such networks in low-power neuromorphic processors. However, the degree of device mismatch in analog mixed-signal neuromorphic circuits renders the use of pre-trained EBNs challenging, if not impossible. To overcome this issue, we developed a novel local learning rule suitable for on-chip implementation that drives a randomly connected network of spiking neurons into a tightly balanced regime. Here we present the integrated circuits that implement this rule and demonstrate their expected behaviour in low-level circuit simulations. Our proposed method paves the way towards a system-level implementation of tightly balanced networks on analog mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware.

This is in contrast to the widely deployed library-based approach where all the configurations of DNN operations share the same implementation.

Here, we investigate whether fine-grained semantic information, reflecting the relationship between attributes and objects, can be learned from spoken language. To this end, a Fine-grained Semantic Embedding Network (FSEN) for learning semantic representations of spoken language grounded by fine-grained images is proposed. For training, we propose an efficient objective function, which includes a matching constraint, an adversarial objective, and a classification constraint. The learned speech representations are evaluated using two tasks, i.e., speech-image cross-modal retrieval and speech-to-image generation. On the retrieval task, FSEN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both a scene image dataset and two fine-grained datasets.

In this work, ring-based networks of Chua's circuits, the simplest electronic oscillators that perform chaotic and well-known bifurcation phenomena, have been extensively studied in memristive crossbars (Xbar), revealing various collective spatio-temporal behaviors, such as chimera states. With respect to different Xbar connectivities and via SPICE-level circuit simulations, the proposed Xbar system proves its efficacy to reproduce spatio-temporal patterns spanning from complete synchronization and chimera states up to fully chaotic states.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401669","Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401669","Chua's Circuits;Memristors;Crossbar;Chimera states;Network Dynamics;Synchronization","Couplings;Time series analysis;Memristors;Integrated circuit interconnections;Programming;Synchronization;Oscillators","","6","","33","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The impact of RF power on the device characteristics was investigated using five different RF powers ranging from 116 W (RF 20%) to 356 W (RF 60%), resulting in different film deposition rates. Depending on RF power, both the initial device resistance (Rinitial) and forming voltage (Vform) were found to be changed. The switching layer sputtered at 116 W shows the highest Rinitial (80 GΩ), whereas the lowest resistance (50 kΩ) is obtained at 236 W. The device RESET level (Roff) is a function of Rinitial and Vform. The largest memory window (Roff / Ron ~ 105) and 2-bit MLC operation are achieved at 236 W deposition power. These devices show excellent retention at 125 °C for 104 seconds and good endurance up to 106 cycles. These results reflect the impact of the sputtering deposition power on the electrical performance of the ReRAM devices. It is due to the fact that the structural defects and oxygen content in the deposited film are modulated by the sputtering power.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401584","Retention;Endurance","Radio frequency;Performance evaluation;Resistance;Switches;Sputtering;Tuning;Switching circuits","","3","","28","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose an ultra-low power oscillator circuit that exploits a stack of small ring oscillators for supply current reuse and injection locking, which provides phase noise improvement.

Compared to the classic bootstrapped switch, this design accelerates the rising speed of gate voltage through four novel techniques. First, an extra NMOS transistor is added to pull up the gate voltage by injecting extra charges into the gate node. Second, the parasitic capacitance at the gate node is reduced by simplifying the circuit structure, leading to a faster speed. Third, transmission gates are used to reduce the two delays to one delay. Fourth, the voltage stored on the capacitor is increased to slightly larger than VDD, which leads to a faster gate-voltage rising speed as well as a larger value of gate voltage (about Vn+1.05 VDD). The larger gate voltage also helps reduce the on-resistance of the bootstrapped switch, which is helpful for the high-speed sampling of ADCs. In a 40 nm CMOS process, post-layout simulation results show that the rising speed of gate voltage is increased by 3.3 times compared to the classic thin-oxide bootstrapped switch circuit. And the on-resistance of the bootstrapped switch is reduced by 2.2 times compared to the classic structure, due to the larger gate voltage value.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401785","Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401785","Bootstrapped Switch;High-Speed;Reduced On- Resistance;Rising Speed Acceleration","Simulation;Switches;Logic gates;CMOS process;Delays;Acceleration;Switching circuits","","5","","18","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, two novel hardware designs to represent the exponential chaotic map have been suggested. We have employed a perturbation method to avoid the chaotic degradation. 64-bit fixed-point and 32-bit floating-point formats were investigated. Moreover, an approximation of Euler's number by a finite series and the Horner's method have been undertaken to further minimize the proposed hardware. Results show that both proposed hardware architectures consume a fewer number of components. The designed systems present a positive Lyapunov exponent, which suggests a chaotic behavior.

Reliability of bit stored in an SRAM cell is often measured by mean time to failure (MTTF). In this work, a method to estimate the statistical distribution of time to failure of a stored bit in an SRAM cell is proposed. The proposed method includes a composition of a trapping/detrapping current injection model, a Monte-Carlo simulator, and a circuit-level abstraction of an SRAM cell. As an example of the proposed method, using circuit-level simulations, the effect of RTN due to a single-trap model is showcased for 45 nm CMOS technology. As anticipated, the SRAM time to fail distribution worsens with a reduction in the supply voltage or with increase in process variations. More importantly, the time to fail distribution and its worsening have been numerically estimated using the proposed method.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401180","SRAM;RTN;mean time to failure;circuit reliability;Monte-Carlo method","Semiconductor device modeling;Computational modeling;SRAM cells;CMOS technology;Numerical models;Integrated circuit modeling;Integrated circuit reliability","","","","15","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a compact time-sharing solution for energy harvesting and vibration sensing by making full use of a modified buck-boost design. The circuit works in a strong discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). It is based on the principle that, under DCM operation, the voltage levels of the piezoelectric source side and the storage side are proportional to the actively switch- on and passively freewheeling intervals, respectively. Compared with the other self-powered synchronized switch PEH solutions, which rely on analog peak detectors, this self-sensing solution not only provides synchronized triggering signals for carrying out the switching actions but also tells more information about the driven vibration, such as its frequency and displacement magnitude.

Vertical integration trends in domain-specific compute systems, as well as software-hardware co-design, are often covered in classroom lectures, but are not reflected in laboratory exercises due to complex tooling and simulation infrastructure.

Rincón-Mora",NA; NA,2021 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS),"27 Apr 2021","2021","","","1","5","Power-conversion efficiency is critical in power supplies. Switched inductors are popular in this space because they can deliver a large fraction of the power they draw. This fraction hinges on the power that switches, diodes, resistances, and capacitances need to conduct and transfer power to the output. So, understanding how these loss mechanisms set and dictate efficiency across power levels is important, especially when designing and targeting particular load levels. This article details how these losses scale, when they dominate, and how and when they balance. Gate drive and controller losses are the ones that become a smaller fraction of input power as output power increases, leading to the increase of the power efficiency at the low-end of discontinuous conduction scale, while only gate charge loss plays this role at the low-end of the continuous conduction scale. Ohmic loss is the one that reduces power efficiency at the high-end of discontinuous and continuous conduction scale as ohmic loss becomes a larger fraction of input power as output power increases. Power efficiency peaks in continuous conduction when ohmic loss and gate charge losses balance. Overlap and dead time losses, although still important, do not shape the power efficiency in continuous conduction mode. In discontinuous conduction mode, all losses play a role and efficiency peaks when they all trickily balance. With this insight, predicting and controlling when efficiency rises, peaks, and falls across loads are possible. The fractional loss analysis and the design insight that make this possible are new contributions to the state of the art.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401531","Texas Instruments; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401531","Switched inductor;power efficiency;interpretation;fractional losses;loss dominance;optimization;design insight;peak efficiency","Shape;Power supplies;Switches;Logic gates;Power generation;Optimization;Switching circuits","","1","","29","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In one approach, spatial features extracted by a time-distributed convolutional neural network are temporally aggregated by recurrent neural networks to predict traffic volume. In the other approach, 3D convolutional neural network extracts the spatiotemporal features across the input frames and predicts the traffic volume. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to estimate traffic volume in an end-to-end fashion. To promote research and development for the solution of this particular problem, we contribute a challenging dataset and therefore, establish a competent baseline method for comparative analysis.

Despite significant improvement in gait recognition with deep learning, existing studies still neglect a more practical but challenging scenario — unsupervised cross-domain gait recognition which aims to learn a model on a labeled dataset then adapt it to an unlabeled dataset. Due to the domain shift and class gap, directly applying a model trained on one source dataset to other target datasets usually obtains very poor results. Therefore, this paper proposes a Transferable Neighborhood Discovery (TraND) framework to bridge the domain gap for unsupervised cross-domain gait recognition. To learn effective prior knowledge for gait representation, we first adopt a backbone network pre- trained on the labeled source data in a supervised manner. Then we design an end-to-end trainable approach to automatically discover the confident neighborhoods of unlabeled samples in the latent space. During training, the class consistency indicator is adopted to select confident neighborhoods of samples based on their entropy measurements. Moreover, we explore a high- entropy-first neighbor selection strategy, which can effectively transfer prior knowledge to the target domain.

Ternary logic with three logic levels can reduce the number of logic operations and enhance the computing speed compared to the binary logic. In this paper, a ternary logic-in-memory scheme is proposed based on the memristive dual-crossbar structure where the inputs and outputs are represented by the multi-level cells of memristors. Two inter-crossbar ternary logic gates and one intra-crossbar binary logic gate for both row and column-wise operations are supported in the proposed scheme to effectively reduce the operation latency. Experimental results show that the operation steps of the proposed multi-trit ternary adder are reduced by up to 83.82%, as compared with previously published binary memristive logic designs. The computation energy consumed by the proposed ternary adder is also reduced by up to 35.87% as compared to previously published binary IMPLY logic design.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401308","ternary logic-in-memory;memristive-crossbar;multi-level cell;ternary adder;carbon nanotube transistors","Resistance;Memristors;Logic gates;Multivalued logic;Logic design;Transistors;Adders","","5","","15","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper simulates the Bitcoin blockchain network traffic in a realistic setting and studies the impacts of both logical and physical network structure on the traffic redundancy. Firstly, we construct an Internet AS layer topology graph and map the Bitcoin nodes to the ASes. Then, Bitcoin 's neighbor discovery algorithm is used to connect Bitcoin nodes together logically. Finally, we simulate the Internet traffic generated by Bitcoin 's flood-based broadcast algorithm in the AS layer topology graph. Specifically, the traffic that a message generates is calculated by the number of ASes a message passes through times the message size. The difference between the total and effective traffic (i.e., the theoretical minimum) is considered traffic redundancy. Simulations show that traffic redundancy is positively correlated with the Bitcoin network scale and the number of peer neighbors for each node. Meanwhile, the underlying physical network topology, especially the average routing path length between the Bitcoin nodes, determines the traffic redundancy as well. Our findings imply that one can optimize the blockchain network's throughput by altering the underlying physical network, e.g., migrating from the Internet to a satellite environment.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401386","traffic redundancy;data broadcasting","Network topology;Redundancy;Bitcoin;Blockchain;Peer-to-peer computing;Internet;Topology","","3","","15","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the events of failure of components or subsystems, the states of the power network will be monitored, collected, and transmitted in real time to the control center, where control algorithms are performed to generate commands for controlling the power at each node. We develop an optimization algorithm for the control center that maximizes power generation and avoids power imbalance between generators and loads and overloading on each component. The vulnerability of the cyber-coupled power system to initial component failures is assessed based on the model and cyber faults that damage the state-monitoring and controlling function of the cyber layer are considered. Simulation results demonstrate that a power system coupled with a cyber control system can effectively reduce the cascading failure risk. However, the control dysfunction of the cyber layer leads to catastrophic cascading failure and intensifies the extent of power outage, making the system more vulnerable to cascading failure.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401753","National Natural Science Foundation of China; University of Hong Kong; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401753","","Simulation;Power system protection;Control systems;Power systems;Power system reliability;Power system faults;Monitoring","","2","","12","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides they can reach mutual cooperation with cooperative strategies, thus they attract much attention. In this work, we study the evolution of submissive strategies in competition with defection on the clustered scale-free networks. Our investigation shows that part of the submissive strategies can dominate defection on the clustered scale-free network under both accumulated and normalized payoff frameworks. Particularly, under the accumulated payoff framework, clustered scale-free networks with high values of the clustering coefficient promote the emergence of submissive strategies, but under the normalized payoff framework, submissive agents eliminate defection in the clustered scale-free networks with low values of clustering coefficient.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-9201-7","10.1109/ISCAS51556.2021.9401391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9401391","","Circuits and systems;Complex networks","","","","28","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We processed full stage multispectral images from four site-years (two sites during two years) of a wheat breeding project, and determined the prediction accuracy of the image-based predicted yields and compared them to the harvested yields taken in the field. The results compared the wheat images throughout the season and validated the most crucial flying times for acquiring images were at late-heading, late-flowering, dough-development, and harvesting stages. The two most useful colour-bands for yield prediction were red and red-edge. We found that removing these bands significantly decreased the prediction correctness.
