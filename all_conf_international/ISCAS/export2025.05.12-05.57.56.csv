As a result of the increased use of power electronics for controlling power flows in power systems, interactions of power electronics systems and conventional synchronous machines' dynamics would inevitably cause stability and robustness concerns, which can be readily understood by the coupling effects among interacting dynamical systems of varying stability margins (or transient performances). In this overview lecture, we present the various problems of power electronics penetration into power grids and the implications on the stability and robustness of power networks.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180388","","Power system stability;Power electronics;Load modeling;Power system dynamics;Stability criteria;Mathematical model","","","","30","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The oscillation frequency is dictated by the number of stages in the chain and the average delay of the inverters. In deep submicron processes, the very short propagation delay of logic gates makes the ring oscillator a very energy-efficient solution for high frequencies of operation, whereas for low frequencies the efficiency generally drops because larger capacitances must be driven to slow down the transitions. In this paper we propose a topology of oscillator that employs four injection-locked stacked ring oscillators, reusing current while the available supply potential is divided among these stages, naturally reducing the oscillation frequency while maintaining energy efficiency. The output signal is recovered to the supply rails through a level shifter circuit with feedback, allowing to adjust its threshold to deal with PVT variations. Simulation results show that the circuit operates from 3–10 MHz, while consuming 0.7 μW at 10 MHz, with a phase noise of −88.8 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset, leading to a FoM of −160 dB.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180389","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180389","Ring oscillator;stacked oscillator;duty-cycle calibration;current-starved inverter","Inverters;Ring oscillators;Frequency measurement;Voltage measurement;Power measurement;Measurement uncertainty","","3","","10","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Level shifter (LS) blocks usually interface these power domains to guarantee fitting voltage levels for the control signals among low supply and high supply voltage domains. Using only thin-oxide transistors for LS implementations enables their subsequent integration into the digital domain of an SoC and enhances circuit speed performance. Nevertheless, thin devices entail overvoltage issues when the voltage difference between the supply domains to be communicated is large, e.g. during the SoC's power-up sequence. Here we propose an LS architecture along with a three-devices protection scheme to avoid powering-up overvoltage issues, which have been neglected by reported LS works, validated through simulations. The results disclose a maximum operating frequency of 400MHz and an average energy-per-transition of 470fJ.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180390","","Voltage control;Transistors;Stress;Logic gates;Computer architecture;Integrated circuit reliability","","4","","8","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the high damping and low mechanical sensitivity of the sensing element, a high polarization voltage of 30V is used to boost the oscillation amplitude of the drive resonator, and a low-noise trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) is designed to reduce the noise contribution of interface. Moreover, the phase regulation of the drive channel is achieved by a phase locking loop (PLL) with 0.1° phase adjustment for sense synchronous demodulation, eliminating the dc error caused by the split-mode phase delay, and a novel switch-capacitor (SC) amplitude regulation scheme is proposed for noise and area reduction. The output of the sense channel is digitized by a 2nd-order Σ-Δ ADC and further processed by a 58th-order FIR filter and 3rd-order temperature compensation.

Moreover, the maximum number of output codeword that can be produced by the modulator is mathematically derived. Following the derivation, a control scheme is proposed to achieve 1.5-bit effective feedback without changing the quantizer and D/A topology.

We propose a novel way of compensating both the VCO non-linearity and the phase noise effects. By means of a time varying switched-capacitor circuit, we build a purely analog compensation loop where jitter clock and DAC non-linearity do not suppose a limitation.

A 3×3 convolver is asked to produce an output every cycle and is commonly accomplished by summing up the results of nine parallel multiplications, which requires ten carry-propagation adders (CPAs) in total. However, the proposed coarse-grained convolver can break the boundary between multipliers and reduce all partial products in a more global way. Consequently, it requires only one CPA to generate the final outcome. It also features a globally delay-optimized partial product reduction tree and a depth-first compression scheme for both area and power minimization.

Challenge-response authentication and key generation (key storage) are well known as major applications using PUFs. When PUFs are applied to these applications, min-entropy estimation is essential. The min-entropy is a measure of the lower bound of the unpredictability of PUF responses. Many studies have estimated the min-entropy of PUFs, and several of these studies dealt with PUFs with independent and identically distributed (IID) PUF responses. Few studies have focused on non-IID PUFs. One reason is that some causes of entropy loss are complicatedly intertwined, and the entropy estimation of non-IID PUFs is hard. Thus, it is first necessary to break down the intertwined causes to estimate min-entropy. In this paper, we present typical causes of entropy loss during PUF implementation and propose a cause analysis method using the Inter-Hamming distance (HD), which is one of major performance metrics of PUFs. And the proposed method was applied to prototyped PUFs designed with a 180-nm CMOS process.

Moreover, the BS segment recognition algorithms that are meant to be applied in the wearable healthcare scenes are further required to retain a low computation complexity. In this work, a light weighted BS recognizer based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed for wearable systems. Specifically, the proposed recognizer firstly converts each one-dimensional segment into a two-dimensional spectrogram by calculating the Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs) frame by frame and then passes the spectrogram through a CNN to infer the category of the segment. To validate the CNN-based BS recognizer, a 28 minutes of BS dataset that contains 955 BS-present segments and 725 BS-absent segments are made. Experimental results on the dataset show that the recognizer attains the 91.25% and 90.83% mean accuracies for the ‘not-across-subjects’ and ‘across-subjects’ validation, respectively. Moreover, compared with the state-of-the-art LSTM approach, the CNN-based BS recognizer is light-weighted with only 20.35k parameters, which is a quarter of that of the LSTM. Due to the lower model complexity, the CNN-based BS recognizer has the potential to be integrated into the gateways in a wearable system to secure the function that only the BS-present segments are allowed to be relayed to the remote. User privacy can be better protected in this way.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180432","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180432","Bowel sounds;CNNs;Wearable Systems;MFCCs;leave-one-out cross validation","Training;Biomedical monitoring;Stethoscope;Motion artifacts;Wearable computers;Spectrogram;Monitoring","","10","","12","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is still limited by the readout circuitry which is required to obtain digital bits for image acquisition. The proposed algorithm prevents the saturation of the readout circuitry by modifying the frequency of chip level counter so that it counts in a linear-logarithmic manner.

It has been observed that in biological systems there is a causal relationship between fixational eye movements and target visibility during fixation, which plays a central role in vision. Based on these findings we implemented an active vision system comprising of a DVS mounted on a pan-tilt unit to introduce microscopic and erratic camera movements as a pivot for artificial vision of static scenes. The key principle is that moving the sensor over an image shifts the low temporal frequency power of a static scene into a range that an event-based retina can properly signal and encode it as highly synchronous activity. By characterizing the signal provided by the active vision system we evidenced (1) an amplification of its response to high spatial frequencies; (2) a whitening effect when scaling stimulus contrast to match the structure of natural images; and (3) an equalized response to all possible orientations of static stimuli related to the isotropic statistics of the random-like motion. The design of a further proper anisotropic spatial summation of events with opponent contrast polarity in a biologically-realistic spiking neural network allowed the detection of information relative to the local orientation of stimuli in a fully bio-inspired fashion.

In this paper a novel approach is proposed, consisting in generating the signatures of the internal state using a Hamming code. This allows to cover a larger amount of faults allowing to detect even or odd bit changes, as well as multi-bit and multi-byte changes, the ones that make ciphers more vulnerable to DFA attacks.

Specifically, we propose a Memory-Augmented Auto-Regressive Network (MAAR-Net) for frame prediction in video coding. MAAR-Net regresses the current frame with two nearest frames via an auto-regressive (AR) model to better capture the main spatial and temporal structures. The AR regression coefficients are generated based on adjacent frame information as well as the long-term motion dynamics accumulated and propagated by a convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). To generate the target frame with higher quality, a quality attention mechanism is introduced for the temporal regularization between different reconstructed frames.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work trying to solve this challenge based on reinforcement learning (RL) approach. Specifically, we formulate the bit allocation problem as a Markovian Decision Process (MDP) and train RL agents to automatically decide the quantization parameter (QP) of each coding tree unit (CTU) for HEVC intra coding, according to the task-driven semantic distortion metrics. This bit allocation scheme can maximize the semantic level fidelity of the task, such as classification accuracy, while minimizing the bit-rate. We also employ gradient class activation map (Grad-CAM) and Mask R-CNN tools to extract task-related importance maps to help the agents make decisions.

Accurate distortion estimation without complex pre-coding has always been highly desired. Traditional distortion estimation methods depend roughly on two assumptions—accurate modeling of the DCT coefficients and fine quantization. Unfortunately, these two assumptions may not be satisfied in most video coding situations. This paper proposes two new methods to estimate video coding distortion dropping the above assumptions. The first one is based on function fitting, modeling coding distortion as a function of the ratio of quantization step to the standard deviation of the residual image. The second one is machine learning based, where an ensemble learning model is employed and the feature vector is composed of the distortion of referenced frames, the variance of the residual image and the quantization step. The HEVC reference encoder HM with the hierarchical coding structure is employed for accuracy evaluation. The experimental results show the accuracy of the proposed methods is much higher than that of traditional ones.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180455","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180455","Quantization distortion estimationvideo coding","Distortion;Quantization (signal);Estimation;Discrete cosine transforms;Encoding;Laplace equations;Video coding","","","","15","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a correlation-based calibration method for nonlinearity mismatches in dual-channel TIADCs which behaves well for both wide-band and narrow-band signals. The output samples are calibrated by reducing the residual distortions which are approximated by multiplying the pseudo distortions and the estimated mismatch coefficients. The pseudo distortions are acquired by using a frequency-shifter, a differentiator, and multipliers. The coefficients which indicate the mismatch strength are estimated by eliminating the cross-correlation of the calibrated output samples and the calibrated pseudo distortions at zero lag. Simulations show that the proposed method can improve the SFDR by dozens of dBc for narrow-band input signals, compared with the input-free band method. For the 16-QAM signal, the EVM improvement over the IFB method is 35.48 dB.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180462","time-interleaved;analog-to-digital converter;nonlinearity mismatches;calibration;correlation;background estimation","Calibration;Distortion;Analog-digital conversion;Electrical engineering;Correlation;Estimation;Circuits and systems","","","","0","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the thermal problem becomes the main design challenge in the current NoC systems due to the high-diverse workload distribution and large power density. Therefore, the Proactive Dynamic Thermal Management (PDTM) is employed as an efficient way to control the system temperature in modern multicore systems. Based on the predicted temperature information, the PDTM can control the system temperature in advance, which helps to reduce the performance impact during the temperature control period. However, the conventional temperature prediction model is usually built based on several specific physical parameters, which are usually temperature-sensitive as well. As a result, the current temperature prediction models still suffer from large prediction errors, which reduces the benefit of the PDTM. To solve this problem, we combine the artificial neural network and LMS adaptive filter theory to propose an adaptive machine learning-based temperature prediction model. Because the proposed model can adapt to the hyperplane of the temperature behavior of NoC system during the runtime, the proposed approach can reduce average error by 37.2% to 62.3%, which helps to improve the system performance by 9.16% to 38.37% and can bring smaller area overhead than the related works by 18.59% to 22.11%.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180475","online learning;neural network;temperature prediction;thermal management;NoC;Network on Chip","Predictive models;Adaptation models;Temperature sensors;Temperature control;Temperature;Computational modeling;Artificial neural networks","","6","","12","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These approaches do not consider the optimization for hardware implementation of the learning models. In this paper, a new thresholding method is proposed based on comparators integrated into the most discriminative layers of the DNN determined by their layer-wise fired neuron rates between adversarial and normal inputs. Effectiveness of the method is validated on the ImageNet dataset with 8-bit truncated models for the state-of-the-art DNN architectures.

The simulation results indicate that the number of secret bits that leaked from the protected design (i.e., the mutual information) was reduced dramatically from 4 bits to 0.85 bits. In addition, at least 1500 ideal noise-free power traces were required to extract these bits, whereas less than 150 traces were required to extract the whole 4 bits from the unprotected design.

Recently, taking advantage of the exponential growth in computing power, machine learning (ML) approaches such as neural networks (NNs) are being considered for HT detection. However, the circuit structure and components of an IC design are different from the data types in the ML models. To efficiently extract HT features from complex IC designs and utilize common ML-based detection approaches is challenging. In this paper, a novel HT feature extraction strategy based on gate-level circuit netlists is proposed to tackle the challenges. The HT features are extracted from the circuit topology rather than statistical analysis in previous research. A commonly utilized support vector machine (SVM)-based HT detection model is employed for data training and testing using the extracted features on HT benchmarks from both open-sourced library and HT generation platform to prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed HT feature extraction strategy. The detection results show high recall in nearly all tested benchmarks, achieving at most 97.7% recall on sequential Trojans and 84.8% on combinational ones.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180479","Hardware Trojans;feature extraction;netlist;circuit topology;directed graph;structural features;machine learning","Statistical analysis;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction;Hardware;Data models;Trojan horses;Integrated circuit modeling","","18","","14","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Four-level pulse amplitude modulation (4-PAM) has become the standard technique at 56–64 and 112 Gb/s. However, whereas decision feedback equalization (DFE) with 5 taps or more was common for 2-PAM links at lower data rates, the speculative look-ahead techniques required to satisfy a DFE's timing requirements at 56 Gb/s increase power consumption exponentially with the number of taps and the number of modulation levels. Thus, 4-PAM DFEs at 56 Gb/s are generally limited to 2 taps or fewer. This limitation, in turn, necessitates the use of long (10 taps or more) finite impulse response (FIR) feed-forward equalization (FFE) to accurately eliminate the intersymbol interference in long reach (LR) channels. Thus, LR receivers at 56–64 and 112 Gb/s comprise an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) followed by digital equalization, and the transmitters increasingly use a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) preceded by a digital filter. Discrete multitone (DMT) signalling obviates the need for a long FIR FFE and DFE, and has demonstrated better spectral efficiency than 4-PAM above 50 Gb/s. In this work, we consider the potential of DMT for wireline communication beyond 100 Gb/s. For example, a spectral efficiency of 2.5 bits/sample is achievable over an IEEE P802.3ck channel with 18 dB loss at 40 GHz, affording an aggregate data rate of 200 Gb/s at 80 GS/s with 150 fs of jitter and 1.26 mV of noise at the input to the receiver. Significant improvement in bit error rate (BER) is obtained by increasing DAC resolution to 8 bits.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180482","Wireline communication;Discrete multitone (DMT)","Receivers;Jitter;Decision feedback equalizers;Signal to noise ratio;Modulation;Data models;Transmitters","","8","","18","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Brain micromotions and tissue damage can be effectively reduced in two ways: (i) miniaturization of the implantable device footprint and (ii) choosing flexible materials for the device substrate. To meet these requirements, in this work we perform two sets of modelling using finite element method in COMSOL Multiphysics. First, we model the performance of different materials ranging from stiff (e.g. Silicon) to very soft (e.g. PDMS) with different sizes to find the optimal dimension and material for the microprobe. For the device size optimization, the main degree of freedom is thickness, while the minimum shank width and length depend on the recording sites and the target recording point, respectively. Modelling devices with different thicknesses (50 − 200 μm) and fixed shank width (100 μm) based on different substrates, we show that the Polyimide-based microprobe exhibits a safety factor of 5 to 15 and maximum von mises stress of 248–770 MPa. Further, simulations indicate that the Polyimide-based microprobe of 50 μm thickness, exhibiting safety factor of 5 and stress of 248 MPa, provides the optimal solution in terms of size and material. Second, to analyse the device shape factor, we model different layouts based on the obtained optimal design and find that the optimal layout features von mises stress of 134.123 MPa, which is versatile and suitable to be used as microprobe especially for the brain micromotion effects mitigation purpose.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180497","Brain Implantable device;Brain Micromotion;Device modelling;Miniaturization;Mechanical flexibility;Shape factor","Brain modeling;Substrates;Layout;Electrodes;Probes;Stress;Analytical models","","4","","16","Crown","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tracking this resistance is seen to be fundamental to the success of electronic systems mounted on a flexible substrate subjected to various levels of bending throughout its life cycle. The measurement technique exploits the electrostatic discharge protection circuitry in an IC chip to create a circuit loop involving the contact resistance and the series incremental resistance of the ESD circuit via two IC pins, one being the GND or VDD pin. While the series contact resistance between the pins of the IC package and the board can be measured with a four-point Kelvin measurement, it is extremely difficult to perform with small surface-mount IC package devices.

Using high-frequency transducer could reduce the size of the acoustic focal spot, thereby improving the resolution of microscopy.

In this paper, an attenuation compensation for high-frequency acoustic-resolution photoacoustic imaging is proposed. This technique upgrades the wavenumber term by considering acoustic attenuation and dispersion during wavefield extrapolation, which is a Fourier-domain image reconstruction. It is able to deal with the space-variant attenuation effect and inherits the high computational efficiency of wavefield extrapolation methods.

For PLLs, the pull-in range characterizes the maximal frequency detuning under which the system provides phase locking (mathematically, every solution of the system converges to one of the equilibria). The presence of periodic nonlinearities (characteristics of phase detectors) and infinite sequences of equilibria makes rigorous analysis of PLLs very difficult in spite of their seeming simplicity. The models of PLLs can be featured by multi-stability, hidden attractors and even chaotic trajectories. For this reason, the pull-in range is typically estimated numerically by e.g. using harmonic balance or Galerkin approximations. Analytic results presented in the literature are not numerous and primarily deal with ordinary differential equations. In this paper, we propose an analytic method for pull-in range estimation, applicable to synchronization systems with infinite-dimensional linear part, in particular, for PLLs with delays.

An internal dither-tracking comparator yet guarantees rail-to-rail operation, resulting in no penalty in conversion accuracy. The comparator functions as a physical-random source for dithering. The unpredictable randomness based on comparator metastable operation by thermal noise enhances the security level while the shared use of the comparator reduces the associated hardware overhead. The additional silicon area penalty for the proposed technique is only 7% of an unprotected ADC core area. A 10-bit 1 MS/s secure SAR ADC was fabricated in 0.18 um CMOS.

The representation allows complex arithmetic to be performed with very simple logic, but it suffers from high latency and poor precision. Furthermore, the results are always somewhat inaccurate due to random fluctuations. In this paper, we show that randomness is not a requirement for this computational paradigm. If properly structured, the same arithmetical constructs can operate on deterministic bit-streams, with the data represented uniformly by the fraction of 1's versus 0's. This paper presents three approaches for the computation: relatively prime stream lengths, rotation, and clock division. Unlike stochastic methods, all three of our deterministic methods produce completely accurate results. The cost of generating the deterministic streams is a small fraction of the cost of generating streams from random/pseudorandom sources. Most importantly, the latency is reduced by a factor of (1/2n), where n is the equivalent number of bits of precision. When computing in unary, the bit-stream length increases with each level of logic. This is an inevitable consequence of the representation, but it can result in unmanageable bit-stream lengths. We discuss two methods for maintaining constant bit-streams lengths via approximations, based on low-discrepancy sequences. These methods provide the best accuracy and area x delay product. They are fast-converging and therefore offer progressive precision.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180521","Deterministic computing;fast-converging process;low-discrepancy (LD) bit-streams;pseudorandomized bit-stream;stochastic computing;unary bit-streams","Informatics;Manganese;Fluctuations;Clocks;Delays;Very large scale integration;Uniform resource locators","","1","","0","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This scheme is expected to support intelligent analysis when the bitstream is partially decoded, as well as high-fidelity reconstruction of image when the bitstream is completely decoded. We implement such a semantically scalable image coding scheme based on semantic map. In the proposed scheme, the original image is firstly semantically segmented and the semantic map is compressed as the base layer. Then, the original image is segmented into several individual objects according to the semantic map, and each object is coded separately. A recurrent neural network-based encoder is used to compress these objects at several quality levels. At the decoder side, the semantic map can be directly applied for intelligent analysis. A generative adversarial network is used to synthesize a rough image using the semantic map. If user is interested in a certain object, more bits can be transmitted to enhance the quality of the object. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves comparable compression performance with JPEG2000 at high bit rates, while facilitates intelligent analysis at low bit rates.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180529","","Semantics;Image coding;Image reconstruction;Transform coding;Encoding;Image segmentation;Scalability","","2","","21","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the forward and backward phase using almost the same computation, the algorithm is an interesting candidate for implementing on-chip learning. As a first step towards building the hardware, we apply quantization on the algorithm to study the feasibility of a digital implementation.

Most of the software implementations on security enclaves offer a framework that can be implemented on any processor architecture. Assuming that privilege escalation is not possible through software means, the only way to access protected data is over authentication over a driver in kernel mode. However, the use of hardware back-doors cannot prevent processor execution in more privileged modes. Implementation of kernel-mode allows the reading of sensitive data over the protected regions of memory. In this work, a proposal of crypto-accelerator is described. The peripheral bus in the proposed architecture features a write-only secure memory. That means the cryptography operations on the software level can not read the sensitive data from that secure memory. This approach suppresses any cache coherence manipulator and fault execution-related attacks against reading sensitive data. The peripheral can be useful to accelerate the cryptography operations, and store securely intermediate calculations as well as storing secure keys. The time of execution compared to the software counterpart can be reduced down to 2.5 decades, and the throughput is risen to 3 decades, reaching speeds of 30MB/s for large chunks of data.

This work for the very first time proposes an adaptive transceiver for near zero-residue for full-duplex communication over on-chip interconnects by deploying a residue monitor. The proposed hybrid circuit topology employs low power chargemode integrated circuits compared to traditional high power consuming current-mode and voltage-mode echo-cancellation circuits.

Geophones are one of the commonly used sensors for such applications. However, geophones have a natural frequency response like that of a high-pass filter. In the past, several innovations have been introduced to extend the −3 dB corner frequency of the geophone to capture the natural frequencies of a building around 1 Hz. These involved modifying the physical construction of the geophone, and/or introducing digital signal conditioning which is cost intensive. We investigated several analog circuit techniques such that the overall electrical response of the geophone approximates to a low-pass filter response. In one approach the device is followed by a cascade of an ideal integrator and a lossy integrator. This eliminates the zeros of the device while preserving the natural low-frequency pole of the device. It is desirable to create a low-frequency pole independent of the natural pole of the geophone. In order to achieve this goal we used multi-loop feedback method which affords to a low-pass characteristic where the pole frequency becomes different from the natural pole frequency of the geophone. In the following theoretical foundations for two techniques are presented. Validity of the multi-loop feedback technique has been established by numerical simulations and verified by lab-bench experiments.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180564","Seismic sensor;geophone;frequency response compensator;multi-loop feedback","Sensors;Frequency response;Vibrations;Analog circuits;Transfer functions;Buildings;Impedance","","","","11","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, undesired source-dependent variation of the digital impedance can arise in scenarios where off-the-shelf high-speed analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters commonly have 50 ohm impedance. Further complicating matters, the sensitivity of digital impedance on source resistance appears to also depend on other design parameters of the digital circuit.

Performance parameters such as gain, bandwidth, thermal noise, power dissipation, etc., benefit from this choice. However, in applications where small-signal settling time is critical (e.g., precision switched-capacitor circuits), the unity-gain phase margin, PM, is a parameter of paramount importance.

In particular, when a DNN model is implemented on an edge device, adversaries can physically access the device and try to reveal the implemented DNN model. Therefore, the DNN execution environment on an edge device requires countermeasures such as data encryption on off-chip memory against various reverse-engineering attacks. In this paper, we reveal DNN model parameters by utilizing correlation power analysis (CPA) against a systolic array circuit that is widely used in DNN accelerator hardware. Our experimental results show that the adversary can extract trained model parameters from a DNN accelerator even if the DNN model parameters are protected with data encryption. The results suggest that countermeasures against side-channel leaks are important for implementing a DNN accelerator on FPGA or ASIC.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180580","","Correlation;Mathematical model;Integrated circuit modeling;Registers;Arrays;Cryptography;Power demand","","19","","8","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the comprehensive models for 3DHTs are available in recent work, there still lacks 3DHT detection and mitigation methods, especially run-time countermeasures against 3DHTs. This work proposes to leverage the 3D communication infrastructure, 3D network-on-chips (NoCs), to tackle the cross-tier hardware Trojans in stacked multi-tier chips. An invariance checking method is further proposed to detect the Trojans that induce malicious NoC packets or facilitate information leak. The proposed method is successfully deployed in NoC routers and achieves a Trojan detection rate of over 94%. The synthesis result of a hardened router at a 45nm technology node shows that the proposed invariance checking only increases the area by 6.49% and consumes 3.76% more dynamic power than an existing 3D router. The NoC protected with the proposed method is applied to the image authentication in a 3D system.

Such a situation has been recast into a consensus problem with on-off control, as suggested by other studies. However, it is commonly assumed that the underlying graph is undirected and the DoS attack follows certain periodic patterns. Obviously, these assumptions cannot truly reflect some real cases. Therefore, aperiodic attacks and directed topology are considered here. Our theoretical results reveal that consensus is achievable, provided that the average of the DoS attack duration over a certain length of time interval is upper bounded.

Verifying the instruction execution against a golden execution model following the ISA is becoming a common practice to verify processors. Despite many potential applications, existing verification frameworks require an extensive test set to cover most of the processor states. In this paper, we suggest a verification scheme combining two different domains, simulation- and formal-verification, establishing a methodology for exclusive error detection. The first approach drives automatic program generation using genetic algorithms to maximize coverage of the test and the contrast against an instruction set simulator. The second is a formal verification approach, where an interface carries specific processor states according to the ISA specification. By combining these two, we present a reliable way to perform more accurate instruction verification by increasing processor state coverage and formal assertions to detect different kinds of errors. Compared to extensive torture test sets, this approach reaches a more significant number of internal states by taking advantage of the exercised abstractions. Among remarkable results to highlight, the proposed approach detected a RISC-V ISA specification gap revealing ambiguity from two different verification perspectives.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180589","","Micromechanical devices;Registers;Computer architecture;Hardware;Instruction sets","","7","","9","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, a 12-stage amplifier chain can be formed by applying different challenges to the aforesaid analog multiplexers with a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). Due to the inevitable process variation, the output voltage of the amplifier chain's last stage varies depending on the various combinations of the selected amplifiers, whose number features an exponential relationship with the size of the adopted amplifier array. By using 65nm standard CMOS process, the proposed strong PUF implementation is validated with high reliability and randomness. According to our extensive simulation results, the averaged bit error rate (BER) per 10°C and BER per 0.1V are calculated to be 3.15% and 3.85% for the operating temperature range of −20°C∼120°C and supply voltage range of 0.9V∼1.4V, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed strong PUF's high randomness is also verified by passing both the NIST and auto-correlation function (ACF) test suites. Moreover, featuring an excellent uniqueness of 49.54%, the overall power consumption is simulated to be 0.128μW at the throughput of 0.02Mb/s, which corresponds to an energy consumption as low as 6.4pJ/bit.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180597","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180597","","Bit error rate;Computer architecture;Multiplexing;Reliability;Transistors;Microprocessors;Power demand","","2","","14","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Power (or energy) packet and its dispatching system is also a cyber-physical approach to the DC system. The concept of power packet is tracing the packets in information networks. A power packet consists of a unit of DC power and the information tag which is attached to the power as voltage waveforms.

Therefore, a controller sharing concept is proposed for saving the circuit area. The controller sharing solution is stemmed from the time multiplexing concept.

The aim is to increase the total photodiode sensitive area to achieve higher output pulsed current values by maintaining unaltered the response time, the bandwidth and the reverse bias voltage proper of each single photodiode. This result is important for many modern applications in biophysics and biomedicine like the brain machine interfaces, that require real time evaluation of environmental/sample changes through the acquisition of signals at high data rates under high signal-to-noise ratio conditions. As a consequence, these applications use sub-nanosecond laser pulses that are revealed by large bandwidth photodiodes having small sensitive area to attain low values of the internal junction capacitance. Thus, any small optical misalignment between the laser beam and the photodiode sensitive area in transcutaneous optical biotelemetry strongly decreases the system detection efficiency and performances. The proposed optoelectronic system resolves this problem being capable to sum in-phase the current pulses generated by each one of the photodiodes forming the array into a single current pulse maintaining the condition of fast response in terms of rise and fall times and bandwidth. This solution employs a Kirchhoff node to sum the different photocurrents, a decoupling current buffer and a transimpedance amplifier to amplify the current pulses summed at the node. We investigated the performances of the optoelectronic system by using photodiodes with different sensitive areas and junction capacitances (i.e., different bandwidths and rise and fall times) for laser pulses repetition rates up to 200 MHz. We also experimentally characterized the circuitry composed by an array of 4 fast photodiodes by using 800 ps laser pulses at a repetition rate of 200 MHz proving that the achieved response times and bandwidth remain the same of those ones of each single photodiode. Moreover, we demonstrated that the maximum value (i.e., the peak) of the obtained output current pulses is multiplied by a factor 4, i.e., equal to the number of the photodiodes forming the array having an overall sensitive area enhanced by the same factor.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180609","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180609","Transcutaneous Biotelemetry;Fast Photodiode Array;Optical Detection System","Photodiodes;Optical sensors;Optical pulses;Biomedical optical imaging;Bandwidth;Silicon;Optical amplifiers","","","","13","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The scripts' primers were compared to manually designed probes that were experimentally tested on a variant (ESR1 p.E380Q), commonly present in metastatic breast cancer, showcasing the applicability of the method and the potential for the script to be used as part of an automated software to design allele-specific assays for Lab-on-Chip platforms in cancer diagnostics.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180613","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180613","","DNA;Isothermal processes;Cancer;Annealing;Python","","3","","13","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, the boundary constraints of the Gaussian parameters are carefully set so that the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) between the original PPG and synthesized PPG can be kept acceptable. From the results, we can see that weighting makes the decomposition stable and the variances of Gaussian parameters reduced. Besides, the modified boundary constraints improve the NRMSE.

One key challenge in maximising NoC performance is traffic congestion. The management of congestion at the earliest stage can significantly minimize the impact on NoC throughput. Prediction of NoC congestion offers a pre-emptive strategy in maximising NoC throughput. This paper proposes a novel spiking neural network (SNN) approach to prediction of traffic congestion. The proposed SNN exploits the temporal nature of the traffic to identify congestion patterns. The proposed SNN explores two models and both are trained and evaluated to predict local congestion 30 clock cycles in advance of occurring. Results shows that the SNN predictor utilizes 9 times less hardware area than previous approaches and can achieved up to 96.59% in accuracy.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180630","","Predictive models;Routing;Prediction algorithms;Neurons;Hardware;Throughput;Adaptation models","","11","","28","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A common method to numerically solve these equations is Euler's method. An important factor that has a significant impact on the performance and cost of the hardware implementation or software simulation of spiking neural networks and yet its importance has been neglected in the published literature, is the time step in Euler's method. In this paper, first the Izhikevich neuron's accuracy as a function of the time step was measured. It was uncovered that the threshold time step that Izhikevich neuron becomes unstable is an exponential function of the input current. Software simulation performance, including total computational time and memory usage were compared for different time steps. Afterwards, the model was synthesized and implemented on the Filed Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Hardware performance metrics such as speed, area and power consumption were measured for each time step. Results indicated that time step has a negative linear effect on the performance. It was concluded that by determining maximum input current to the neuron, larger time steps comparable to those used in the previous works could be employed.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180632","Neuromorphic;SNN;Izhikevich;FPGA;Euler's method;time step;step size","Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Hardware;Field programmable gate arrays;Software","","5","","32","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, non-invasive neurostimulation techniques have been used to treat and manage a diverse range of health conditions, and more recently it has been suggested to enhance human cognition and working memory. In this paper, we propose a low-cost transcranial alternating current neurostimulator wearable targeting frequencies in the theta wave band (4–8 Hz), which are crucial for the functioning of normal memory and attention. Prior work on transcranial stimulation indicates that modulating large-scale neural activity is achievable through both entrainment and resonance effects, by recruiting a larger population of neurons into task-relevant rhythmic firing networks.

These are also called as multicomponent fractors because they require a chain network of resistors and capacitors for their hardware implementation. Generally the values of these components obtained from the approximation algorithms are not standard. Therefore, for their hardware implementation the components are required to be replaced by the nearest standard values. So, in such cases the response of the fractor may deviate from its desired response. Therefore, it is necessary to do an sensitivity analysis of such realizations which will give a choice to a circuit designer for choosing different components for their hardware implementation, when exact values are not available. In this work we have done a sensitivity analysis of the fractor on the use of electrolytic capacitors which are normally of high quality only upto 100 Hz. A comparison has been made between a lower order fractor of order (α = 0.2) and a higher order fractor of order(α = 0.8).

The linearized state-space representation of the weak-grid-tied VSC system is firstly obtained, on which the eigenvalue-based analysis is performed. The loci of the eigenvalues show that the weak-grid-tied VSC system loses stability through a Hopf bifurcation and that improper grid parameters-the active power and the equivalent impedance of the AC system seen from the point of common coupling (PCC), can contribute to the occurrence of the bifurcation behavior of the system.

In addition to the race of miniaturizing the device feature size. However, the main obstacle of enabling such devices is that not all of the MEMS technologies are compatible with integrated circuits (IC) manufacturing process. MEMs' devices that are based on acoustics waves like surface acoustic wave (SAW) and bulk acoustic wave (BAW) overcome aforementioned limitations while providing an outstanding performance. BAW resonator is a new technology raised during the last decade which shows better temperature stability compared to SAW, better selectivity, IC manufacturing process compatibility, and lower insertion loss. Filters based on BAWs show very promising results as well. However, BAW resonators still need optimization to achieve the high-quality factor also the temperature dependency is still a big problem. A novel Thin Film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) design is presented in this paper using aluminum nitride (AlN) as peizoelectric material and Tungsten (W) for the electrodes, with detailed electrical model and FEM simulations using COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS.

Benefitting from the assistance of the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect, the critical write current for 1-ns backup operation can be reduced to 3 μA or even lower, thus resulting in high speed and low power consumption. Moreover, such small write current allows to be driven by the cross-coupled inverters in the master latch, instead of a dedicated write driver, leading to a low cell area overhead. Additionally, by using an antiferromagnetic (AFM) metal that can provide both an exchange bias and the SHE instead of the heavy metal, no external magnetic field is required, making it suitable for practical applications.

Nuclide identification accuracy was determined by performing a defect-oriented testing of the system. Defect analysis and modelling focused on static faults, where the memristor resistivity was stuck at extreme values. Results show that the system has a higher tolerance to static defects where the resistance is jammed at the maximum extreme (effective open circuit) than in the minimum extreme (effective short circuit).

In such case, the delicate design of stateful memristor gates could suffer the reliability problem. Here, such unsafe writing impacts on the memristor-based logic operation is systematically analyzed. Through establishing the Markov chain model of unsafe writing effects, we deduce the mathematical relationship between the material implication (IMP) logic gate reliability and switching probability.

Many approaches have been proposed that simplify the analysis and provide intuition into the operation of these circuits. It is critical to select the proper model when designing LPTV systems: too complex, and intuition is lost; too simple, and numerical accuracy degrades. This work shows how a conversion matrix-based model can be used for mixer-first receivers with complex feedback in the presence of finite switch transitions. This model accurately predicts S11 below −10 dB for all tested transition times, in contrast with prior models, which are shown to be invalid with transitions beyond 2% of the clock period.

However, when applying this to CT incremental ΔΣ modulators, after each periodic reset of the loop-filter, the output of each FIR tap is unrelated to the input signal and a certain amount of time is needed to settle back to a normal operation. This results in a severe swing overshoots at the output of the integrators in the initial phase of every incremental ΔΣ conversion cycle, which limits the dynamic range (DR) of the modulator and thus counteracts the benefits of the FIR DAC. This paper describes the challenges that come with acquiring an FIR DAC in an incremental ΔΣ modulator. Additionally, two design techniques are shown to mitigate the swing overshoots and achieve a normal operation of the modulator. This allows higher number of FIR taps to be used in an incremental ΔΣ modulator, which is very beneficial to promote high speed/resolution designs.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180692","","Finite impulse response filters;Modulation;Jitter;Clocks;Signal resolution;Robustness;Quantization (signal)","","7","","8","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The error at the slicer of the receiver is processed by the backpropagation algorithm, and applied to compensate the TI-ADC mismatches using an adaptive equalizer. Alternatively, the back propagated error is used to estimate the mismatches and correct them with analog techniques. Implementation complexity is low. The main advantages of the technique proposed here compared to prior art are its robustness, its speed of convergence, and the fact that it always works in background mode, independently of the oversampling factor and the properties of the input signal, as long as the receiver converges.

There are four main contributions in this paper. First, the negative-bias temperature-instability (NBTI) degradation of PMOS transistors in the conventional SRAM cell that causes the data imprinting effect is explained. Second, the data imprinting effect that leaks the stored information in the conventional SRAM cell is investigated. Third, a novel low transistor-count transmission-gate-based master-slave SRAM cell is proposed to periodically toggle the stored data for reducing the data imprinting effect. Fourth, an efficient imprinting analysis flow is proposed to evaluate the proposed data-toggling SRAM for quantifying the data imprinting effect. Based on a 65-nm CMOS process, we implement and prototype the proposed 1k-byte data-toggling SRAM design. We perform our imprinting analysis flow on various SRAM ICs and benchmark our proposed data-toggling SRAM IC against the non-toggling SRAM IC and a commercial Lyontek SRAM IC. From the measurement results, the non-toggling SRAM and Lyontek SRAM suffer from 60% and 81% data imprinting effects, respectively, whereas our data-toggling SRAM has only 11% data imprinting effect (at 160-kHz toggling frequency). The data-toggling SRAM could switch between high security (< 5% data imprinting effect) high power mode for hardware security applications and low power (< 0.1mW) low security mode for power-saving applications. Particularly, our data-toggling SRAM could feature as low as ∼1% data imprinting effect when increasing the toggling frequency to 1.6 MHz by compromising the power dissipation. Using the image analysis flow, the stored information is revealed in both the non-toggling and Lyontek SRAM ICs but is well protected in the proposed data-toggling SRAM IC.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180698","Static random access memory (SRAM);high secure;negative bias temperature instability (NBTI);data imprinting","Integrated circuits;Security;Negative bias temperature instability;Thermal variables control;SRAM cells;Frequency measurement","","","","0","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite being primarily a candidate for memory applications, memristors have proven to be beneficial in several other circuits and applications as well. One of the use cases is the implementation of digital circuits such as adders. Among several logic implementations using memristors, IMPLY logic is one of the promising candidates and one of the first stateful logics proposed. In this logic, the result of a IMPLY b (a → b) is stored in b and it is always true (1) except for when a=0 and b=1. Given the intrinsic difference between IMPLY and Boolean logic, conventional operations such as binary addition need to be appropriated for implementation using IMPLY. This appropriation has two main constituents; the topology or structure of the adder and the algorithm performing the addition. In this paper, we proposed a new architecture for a digital full-adder, which is up to 41% faster than existing IMPLY-based serial designs while requiring up to 78% less area (memristors) compared to the existing parallel design. In addition to that, we present a review of the state-of-the-art in IMPLY-based adders, which appeared in the literature during the last five years and discuss their advantages or disadvantages. To be able to compare these designs in a generic condition, we define a Figure of Merit (FoM), in which both the number of memristors (nm) and the number of steps (ns) are equally important. However, we must bear in mind that m (which translates to area and consequently cost) and s (which represents the speed of the full-adder) carry different weights in designs with different constraints. IMPLY-based adders can be divided into two major micro-architectures; i) serial, in which each bit is processed after the other, ii) parallel, in which bits are added in parallel as long as possible. In the first category, relatively speaking, the number of memristors is low and the number of steps is high. This is quite the opposite for the second category. In serial adders, [1] is one of the very first efficient designs, which needs 3n+3 memristors and 29n steps for an n-bit addition. In [2], a different algorithm led to a smaller number of steps, i.e., 23n. These works were improved in terms of FoM, thanks to a new approach proposed in [3], where input memristors were used for storing the output result too. Thus, the new algorithm managed to reduce m and consequently increase FoM, without needing any structural changes. However, this approach, which was adopted by [4] as well, is not suitable for all applications, in particular when the respective input is needed for further operations and its value must not be lost. The parallel design proposed in [1] was for a long time uncontested until recently the authors in [4] proposed an approach, which reduced nm and thus improved FoM by applying a minimal change to the structure. Lastly, in our newer topology, namely semiparallel topology, by having two serial sections in parallel, we managed to considerably reduce the number of steps (compared to serial adders), without needing any additional memristors. The FoM of this design is even better than the parallel approach proposed in [4]. Compared to other serial works our design needs three extra switches, which is negligible compared to 2n and n switches required in the parallel approaches.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180699","Memristors;Topology;Very large scale integration;Adders;Logic gates;Parallel processing","Memristors;Adders;Topology;Very large scale integration;Digital circuits;Computer architecture;Logic gates","","2","","4","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The circuit is tested in a computer vision processing chain as a binary line buffer for the stream of foreground pixels.

To address this concern, logic locking countermeasure transforms a logic circuit to a different one to obfuscate its inner details. The transformation caused by obfuscation is reversed only upon application of the programmed secret key, thus preserving the circuit's original function. This technique is known to be vulnerable to Satisfiability (SAT)-based attacks. But in order to succeed, SAT-based attacks implicitly assume a perfectly reverse-engineered circuit, which is difficult to achieve in practice due to reverse engineering (RE) errors caused by automated circuit extraction. In this paper, we analyze the effects of random circuit RE-errors on the success of SAT-based attacks. Empirical evaluation on ISCAS, MCNC benchmarks as well as a fully-fledged RISC-V CPU reveals that the attack success degrades exponentially with increase in the number of random RE-errors. Therefore, the adversaries either have to equip RE-tools with near perfection or propose better SAT-based attacks that can work with RE-imperfections.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180705","IP-Theft;Logic-Locking;Satisfiability-Based Attacks;Reverse-Engineering Errors","Logic gates;Security;Electronics packaging;Integrated circuits;Boolean functions;Mathematical model;Circuit faults","","2","","33","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the possible variation in the search path length of the SAT-attack, a measure of resilience based on statistical characterization is proposed. A probabilistic model of a SAT-attack search process is developed to properly capture the variation in the path length and report the SAT resilience as an expectation of the computational complexity. An estimator of the expected complexity, assuming an equally likely branching probability, is proposed. The model and the estimator allow for 1) the derivation of a closed-form estimate of the expected security, and 2) characterization of the key search space without experimental bias toward SAT-attack implementation or circuit topology.

Since the oracle responses in test mode do not correspond to the functional key, satisfiability (SAT) attacks are not able to leverage the responses from the scan chain.

However, in both of these schemes, the resiliency to the SAT attack is dependent on a single product term with a large number of literals in the logic-locking function. The corresponding gates can be easily identified by analyzing the signal probability skew. Once they are removed, the logic-locking block is no longer resistant to the SAT attack. This paper proposes a new logic-locking scheme whose function has check board patterns in the corresponding K-map.

Although the resultant ISI must be removed using an equalizer, the lower bandwidth allows for higher gain in the front-end's first stage, lower input-referred noise, and fewer gain stages. With fewer main-amplifier stages, power dissipation is reduced. The noise analysis of these front ends presents several challenges. This paper derives integrated input-referred noise for inverter-based shunt-feedback transimpedance amplifiers from first principles and highlights the importance of correctly estimating the gain and noise bandwidth of the receiver. The notion of the effective gain of the receiver is introduced, which is lower than the midband gain typically used in noise calculations. The analysis of the inverter-based TIA is used to discuss the important design trade-offs depending on the type of equalizer used.

This two-clock phase system is enabled by a passive silicon photonic split and delay structure that eliminates the need for a quadrature clock phase generator and all the associated buffers. Moreover, the outputs of the receiver are demultiplexed which further helps reducing power consumption in the digital part of the system. The receiver also employs inter-stage AC coupling and is mounted on a high-speed printed circuit board (PCB). The impact of AC coupling and PCB parasitics is investigated. The functionality of the receiver is validated by highspeed optical measurements.

It is worth noting that the input-decimation approach is presented to decrease the number of input sequences for the recursive filter so that the computation cycle of RDFT/RIDFT can be shortened to meet the commuting time requirement (3.6 μs) for the high-speed broadband communication systems. Therefore, the input-decimation RDFT/RIDFT algorithm is able to carry out at least 55.5% reduction of the total computation cycles compared with the considered algorithms. Furthermore, holding the advantages of input-decimation technique, the computational complexities of the real-multiplication and −addition are reduced to 41.3% and 22.2%, respectively. The area and the power consumption can be minimized by employing the cost-efficient constant multiplier with the refined signed-digit expression of twiddle factors.

ERSFQ is an energy efficient, inductive bias scheme for RSFQ circuits, where power dissipation is drastically lowered by eliminating the bias resistors while the cell library remains unchanged. An ERSFQ bias scheme requires the introduction of multiple circuit elements — current limiting Josephson junctions, bias inductors, and Josephson transmission lines. Multiple guidelines exist for the effective design of these structures.

This task becomes more relevant in nighttime because accidents considerably increase. Typically, this problem is addressed by segmenting the bright image regions produced by vehicle lights, assuming they are well defined. But, often there are only flashes that occupy large image regions, invalidating the previous strategy. Thus, a real-time vehicle detection algorithm for nighttime that addresses the previous challenge is presented. First, the whole image is characterized by only one descriptor. Then, a grid of foveal classifiers that share the same previous image descriptor (unlike the traditional sliding window scheme) estimates the vehicle positions. Every classifier is trained to detect vehicles in specific image regions by analyzing the complex light patterns in the night. Furthermore, a new nighttime database has been also created to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180730","","Cameras;Prediction algorithms;Feature extraction;Vehicle detection;Databases;Training;Lighting","","","","20","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Next, we compute the volumes of these time-varying quadrilaterals, by generating color-coded images, named spatio-temporal quad-joint relative volume feature maps (QjRVMs). To preserve the pixel frequency distribution while training a DNN, which is otherwise lost due to vanishing gradients and random dropouts, we propose a new architecture CCNNs.

Dedicated designs for the non-linear adders with the common activation functions such as hyperbolic tangent (tanh), logistic (or sigmoid), and rectified linear unit (ReLU) are proposed using the bitonic sorting network and the selective interconnect.

A lot of algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem. One kind of algorithms are based on some hand-crafted features, which often work only in the situations where those hand-crafted features are valid. There are also some algorithms, which use deep learning-based methods to recover clear images, but they depend on the 2D images, and their run time increases rapidly when the size of images gets larger. Moreover, these models need a large dataset to be trained. In this study, we proposed a novel way based on deep learning and histogram matching to overcome these common problems. Firstly, we develop a network with 1D ResNet structure to predict the histogram of a recovered image. Secondly, we match the histograms of the inputs to the outputs of the model, which are processed patch by patch, to get a series of clear patches. Finally, we use an image-guided filter to overcome the unnatural transition between patches. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world hazy images show that our method performs about 3% better in terms of SSIM(structural similarity index) and 15% better in terms of CIEDE2000 than some state-of-the-art methods on a synthetic hazy image dataset.

Existing surveillance video compression schemes are still based on traditional hybrid coding frameworks handling temporal redundancy by block-wise motion compensation mechanism, lacking the extraction and utilization of inherent structure information. In this paper, we alleviate this issue by decomposing surveillance video signals into the structure of a global spatio-temporal feature (memory) and skeleton for each frame (clue). The memory is abstracted by a recurrent neural network across Group of Pictures (GoP) inside one video sequence, representing appearance for elements that appeared inside GoP. While the skeleton is obtained by the specific pose estimator, it served as a clue for recalling memory. In addition, we introduce an attention mechanism to learn the relationships between appearance and skeletons. And we reconstruct each frame with an adversarial training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate realistic frames from appearance and skeleton accordingly.

It is shown that the growth of the entries in both U and L matrices are gradual and follow a geometrical pattern, as the decomposition progresses. Another important feature of the UaL decomposition is that it does not generate nonzero remainders, or simply, it is “cancellation free”.

Unfortunately, chopping causes the demodulation of shaped quantization noise into the signal band. Prior works have analyzed noise-folding effects in chopped integrators that use single-stage and two-stage feedforward-compensated OTAs. These works use restrictive assumptions, like settling of the OTA internal nodes at the chopping instants, and an NRZ feedback DAC waveform. This work gives a general model for aliasing of shaped noise in a chopped integrator that incorporates arbitrary OTAs, arbitrary DAC pulse-shapes, and incomplete settling. Using the theory of linear periodically time-varying (LPTV) systems, we derive a simple simulation test-bench that can be used to estimate the parameters of our model. Thanks to this, the effects on chopping on the performance of the modulator can be rapidly estimated without running long transient simulations. Simulation and experimental results that support our theory are given.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180763","Chop;flicker;aliasing;oversampled;folding;noise;precision;FIR filter;periodic transfer function","Integrated circuit modeling;Analytical models;Electrical engineering;Demodulation;Quantization (signal);Optical signal processing","","","","0","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ultimately, the proposed methodology allows to add microarchitectural adjustment as a run-time knob to augment the energy benefits of wide-voltage scaling.

The large current flowing within the power delivery network leads to challenging issues such as electromigration, low power efficiency, and thermal hotspots. As a technique to reduce on-chip current demand, voltage stacking has become a topic of growing interest within the industrial and academic communities. The challenges of on-chip voltage stacking are however significant. The limitations of relying on on-chip decoupling capacitors when load imbalances occur within a high current system are reviewed. To manage these load imbalances, a ladder topology switched capacitor converter is proposed to regulate the voltages between layers within a voltage stacked system. A 20X improvement in voltage drop is demonstrated on a case study. The current path within a voltage stacked system is quite different from a standard system. A horizontal current path is formed due to the serial connection between layers, producing large parasitic impedances within the power network. The on-chip power network within a voltage stacked system therefore requires careful consideration and specialized design techniques.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180775","Voltage stacking;ladder switched capacitor converter;load balancing;power delivery network","Capacitors;System-on-chip;Voltage control;Switches;Regulators;Stacking","","3","","26","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Energy and area footprints are reduced through techniques at the algorithm, microarchitectural and gate level. At the algorithm level, multiple encryption is introduced to dynamically expand the key length from 64 to 256 bits at minimal reconfiguration complexity, allowing shorter keys and lower energy when lower level of security is demanded. The 1-round parallel architecture with short 32-bit datapath narrows the traditionally large gap between the conventional crypto-core data (e.g., 128 bits) and low-end processors (32 bit or lower), mitigating or eliminating the need for area- and energy-hungry FIFO buffers at their interface. At the gate level, the adoption of multi-bit pulsed latch-based pipelines with internal clock buffer sharing reduces the dominant clock power/area contribution of sequential elements. Tunable clock duty cycle allows time borrowing for improved variation resilience at ultra-low voltages at low hold-fix buffer count, leveraging the inherent margin against hold time violations enabled by relatively uniform pipestage delays.

Then, we analyze the vulnerability of pipelined AES under two scenarios. First, during regular pipeline operation where the device is performing AES pipeline operation. Second, in non-pipeline operation where we assume the adversaries can insert delay to the input of the device to increase the signal to noise ratio of the physical leakage information. The simulation results show that under regular pipelined operation, our proposed power model can reveal all the 16 key bytes in less than 4,900 traces, resulting in 4.7× more effective than the conventional power models.

Zhang","Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA",2020 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS),"28 Sep 2020","2020","","","1","5","Long BCH codes are broadly used in communications and storage. BCH encoders can be implemented by linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs), and modern systems demand parallel encoders to achieve high speed. LFSRs are also used for implementing cyclic redundancy check (CRC). It was shown previously that adding the input to the least significant tap of the CRC LFSR leads to the lowest complexity in the corresponding parallel architecture derived using state transition. However, the analyses for CRC LFSRs do not hold for long BCH encoders, since the parallelism needed is much smaller than the length of the LFSR for long BCH encoders. Besides, additional clock cycles are required to pad zeros to the input in order to derive the same final state for the parities. This paper first proposes a new parallel design that allows the input to be added to any tap without sacrificing the throughput. Then the matrices involved in parallel long BCH encoders are analyzed to identify the input tap leading to minimum complexity. Besides, hardware unit sharing for matrix multiplications is enabled through analyzing the timing of the encoder. For a 32-parallel (8191, 7684) BCH encoder, our design achieves 57% higher efficiency in terms of throughput/area ratio compared to the best prior design.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180783","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180783","","Complexity theory;Throughput;Encoding;Computer architecture;Clocks;Parallel processing;Registers","","5","","10","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional approaches for PN suppression suffer from high computational complexity. To overcome this, we present a low-complexity fully-digital PN suppression for mmWave systems. The key ideas are to exploit the coherence bandwidth of a mmWave system and an approximation of the PN spectrum, based on its Np dominant components. Utilizing these features, the joint estimation problem of PN and channel can be reformulated into a system with the same number of equations and unknowns, which enables low-complexity PN suppression by using a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator. Furthermore, we propose a method to reduce the hardware cost of the LMMSE estimator by using a B-bit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) quantization, which has a very low complexity of O(Np2 + NNp), where N is the number of subcarriers in an OFDM symbol. As a proof-of-concept, a low-cost VLSI architecture is presented to realize the proposed method.

To this end, different compiling methods have been introduced in the past, but room for improvement still exists. Moreover, just an efficient compilation process itself is not sufficient-the resulting circuits must be correct as well. In this summary paper, we review how existing compilation approaches can be optimized by utilizing heuristic search algorithms or exact reasoning engines. Furthermore, we review how the correctness of the obtained results can be verified afterwards by clever data structures such as decision diagrams.

An important component of protocol design is sample preparation, which involves dilution or mixing of two or more fluids in a desired ratio of concentration factors (CF). Existing continuous-flow microfluidic biochips deploy either free-flowing networks where only a single layer of flow-channels is used devoid of any control valves, or valve-based technology where the flow-layer is augmented with a control layer of valves. While the former is easy to fabricate, reliable, and less expensive, they are typically hardwired for specific applications only. The latter class, although programmable, is expensive and prone to various manufacturing and operational defects. In this paper, we present the physical design of a microfluidic network that is free-flowing as well as programmable. The proposed valve-free network resembles a complete binary tree with serpentine obstacles embedded within its channels, and can be used to achieve a desired dilution of a sample just by proper selection of fluid concentrations to be fed as inputs under constant pressure. Simulation with COMSOL Multiphysics Software shows that the proposed network provides a powerful and versatile architecture for solution preparation with minimal control, outperforming prior approaches in terms of the accuracy of CFs and time for convergence.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180795","Electronic Design Automation;Finite Element Analysis;Binary Tree","Valves;Binary trees;Three-dimensional displays;Physical design;Microchannels;Protocols","","2","","25","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The speculation of PSCs consuming the majority of circuit resources in the neuron circuits calls for methods simplifying the PSC. A recently demonstrated NIPIN timekeeping device based selector facilitates this, showing learning with square pulses using its inherent hole storage physics. However, a quantitative advantage achieved by utilizing a timekeeping device to evaluate its necessity is unavailable in the literature. Also, a model is required to carry out large scale circuit simulations for crossbar arrays using this device as selector. In this work, we design and compare the PSCs for different selector devices proposed in the literature to show 133× reduction in energy per spike and 8× reduction in the area of neuron circuit using NIPIN as the selector device compared to previously shown diode selector. We also present an experimentally calibrated model for the device for future explorations. Our results show that the small fraction energy and area occupied by the leaky-integrate and fire part of the circuit makes optimization of PSCs a priority.

Then, supervised SNN training is considered by backpropagation of an error signal that is obtained by comparing the spike pattern at the output neurons with a target pattern representing the desired class. The classification accuracy is measured for various publicly available data sets with tens of thousands of elements, and compared with other learning algorithms, including logistic regression and support-vector machines.

In this paper, we study the effect of coupling patterns on robustness and functionality of cyber-coupled power systems. In a cyber-coupled power system, the cyber nodes to be coupled with power nodes are regarded as decision-making cyber nodes that are selected using a measurement called average propagation latency. Basically, a coupling pattern is formed by ranking the node criticality of the coupled cyber and power nodes, and then connecting them by a specific sequence. We introduce a parameter, called relative coupling correlation coefficient, to quantify the coupling pattern. A lower relative coupling correlation coefficient generally indicates a lower assortativity of coupling, which leads to a degradation of the functionality of coupled systems. Preliminary results show that a coupled system of a lower relative coupling correlation coefficient has better robustness. The finding indicates that increasing coupling assortativity and improving the robustness of a coupled system, are two conflicting objectives. Thus, a multi-objective problem is formulated and the Pareto-optimal solution is derived to balance the two objectives in the optimization of coupling patterns.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180813","","Couplings;Robustness;Decision making;Correlation;Power system faults;Power system protection","","2","","14","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are mainly five contributions in CNN-MP: 1) break the conventional image stitching steps without detecting keypoints; 2) a feature map calculation model is built to obtain matching points between the feature maps of two images; 3) establish a position model to map the obtained matching points to the original images; 4) the process of obtaining matching points is accelerated by dividing it into pre-locate and fine-locate; 5) establish the dataset to evaluate CNN-MP in the case where detectable features are not obvious.

The latter may originate from the inherent operation of the DPLL itself, when operated in Fractional-N mode, or by external aggressors via coupling paths. Moreover, non-linearities of the loop can result in a worsening of the spur level thus in a degradation of the generated frequency modulation. This paper provides an insight on spurs impact in PLL-based chirp generators for radar sensors. Three different scenarios are taken into account: fractional spurs arising from non linearities, spurs coupling to the output of the DPLL and coupling of the digital activity of the divider to the DCO.

Multi-bit CTDSMs offer reduced jitter sensitivity and lower over-sampling ratios, which make them suitable for wideband applications compared to their single-bit counterparts. However, they suffer from the problem of element mismatches in their digital-to-analog converters (DACs). On the other hand, in state-of-the-art CTDSMs, the DACs can consume a significant percentage of the overall power. In this manuscript, we present an active-RC CTDSM with a novel 5-level highly linear switched-capacitor (SC) DAC, which reduces power consumption through charge recycling. Splitting a DAC capacitor into two halves helps avoid harmonic distortions caused by signal-dependent timing of DAC pulses.

In this paper, we propose a reconfigurable parallel-pipelined Hybrid Binary-Unary CNN Accelerator (HBUCNNA) to implement low-cost, high-performance convolutional layers of a ResNet-18 architecture. We use the hybrid binary-unary method to implement banks of constant-coefficient multipliers, which are used to implement convolutional kernels. Moreover, we propose hybrid binary-unary batch normalization units to further improve the total hardware costs. These two units reduce {area, area×delay} costs by {50%, 30%} and {44%, 65%} on average compared to their conventional binary counterparts, respectively. The proposed accelerator stores control signals for reconfigurability instead of the numeric value of weights, which in turn reduces the memory footprint on average by 20%. Overall, the proposed HBUCNNA architecture reduces the {area, latency, power, energy, area×delay} costs on average by {25.5%, 40%, 15%, 40%, 47%} and {53%, 61%, 47%, 62%, 67%} compared to the constant-coefficient multiplier-based and variable size multiplier-based binary architectures, respectively.

Recent efforts in designing CNN accelerators are considered as a promising alternative to achieve higher energy efficiency. Unfortunately, with the growing complexity of CNN, the demanded computational and storage resources for accelerators keep increasing, hindering its wider applications in mobile devices. On the other hand, many quantization algorithms have been proposed for efficient CNN training, which brings many small or zero weights. This is a unique opportunity for accelerator designers to employ much fewer bits, e.g., 4 bits, in both arithmetic core and storage, thereby saving significant design cost. However, such a single precision strategy inevitably compromises the accuracy as some key operations may demand a higher precision. Thus, this paper proposes a low power CNN accelerator architecture that can simultaneously conduct computations with mixed precisions and assign the appropriate arithmetic cores to operation with different precision demands. This proposed architecture can achieve significant area and energy savings, without accuracy compromise.

A CycleGAN has more complex dataflow since it features two generator-discriminator pairs. Massive external memory access also results in a long latency for both training and inference. Data structure for transposed convolution also needs to be tailored. This paper presents the first dedicated CycleGAN accelerator for energy-constrained mobile applications. The numbers of external and internal memory accesses are reduced by 98.3% and 68.3% through spatial data reuse, input feature map reuse, and local data reuse. The computational complexity is reduced by 79.4% by skipping zeros in the transposed convolutional layers. An architecture with two processing cores is proposed to improve the utilization by 2×. Designed in a 40-nm CMOS technology, the proposed CycleGAN accelerator dissipates 445 mW at 227 MHz from a 0.9-V supply.

Two schemes, namely LAC and HQC, in NIST's round 2 phase of its post-quantum cryptography standardisation project use the strong error-correcting BCH code. However, direct application of the BCH code in decryption algorithms of public-key schemes could open new avenues to the attacks. For example, a recent attack [1] exploited non-constant-time execution of BCH code to reduce the security of LAC. In this paper we analyse the BCH error-correcting code, identify computation steps that cause timing variations and design a constant-time BCH implementation. We implement our algorithm in software and evaluate its resistance against timing attacks by performing leakage detection tests. To study the computational overhead of the countermeasures, we integrated our constant-time BCH code in the reference and optimised implementations of the LAC scheme as a case study, and observed nearly 1.1 and 1.4 factor slowdown respectively for the CCA-secure primitives.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180846","","Timing;Arrays;Indexes;Cryptography;Error correction codes;Decoding;Software algorithms","","4","","20","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the proposed ANoC router embodies dual-supply-voltage SAHB cells, where the non-critical subsidiary supply voltage is adjustable from 0.3V to 1.2V, increasing the noise variance and hence reducing the Signal-to-Noise (SNR) ratio to hide the information leakage. Second, the proposed ANoC router performs as a noise engine by increasing the number of power-on IO ports, further randomizing the overall power dissipation.

However, a secure firmware update is a challenging task as IoT devices are often employed in unattended networks. Moreover, malicious updates of firmware in any of the devices of a network, or the non-execution of an update, can create havoc. Although security mechanisms like remote attestation (RA) are quite popular to identify malicious nodes in a network, they are costly in terms of computation/memory usage and communication overhead. To overcome these issues, we propose a “Secure Hardware-enabled Protocol for Firmware Updates (SHeFU)”. The aim of the proposed protocol is two-fold: 1) we obviate the need for remote attestation, and 2) we make sure that malicious nodes are isolated from benign nodes.

Matrix-vector multiplications (MVM) and vector-vector outer product (VVOP) are the two most expensive operations associated with training of DNNs. Strategies to improve the efficiency of MVM computation in hardware have been demonstrated with minimal impact on training accuracy. However, the VVOP computation remains a relatively less explored bottleneck even with the aforementioned strategies. Stochastic computing (SC) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of VVOP computation but on relatively shallow networks with bounded activation functions and floatingpoint (FP) scaling of activation gradients. In this paper, we propose ESSOP, an efficient and scalable stochastic outer product architecture based on the SC paradigm. We introduce efficient techniques to generalize SC for weight update computation in DNNs with the unbounded activation functions (e.g., ReLU), required by many state-of-the-art networks. Our architecture reduces the computational cost by re-using random numbers and replacing certain FP multiplication operations by bit shift scaling.

Novel capabilities are introduced in the memory controller. An access-aware refresh control unit analyses the short-term history of memory accesses translating row activations into refresh masks.

However, the pure serial approach suffers from a long latency and leaves additional room to optimize energy efficiency. We propose three new techniques to develop a novel SRAM structure to realize multi-bit multiplication with bi-serial in/near memory computing. Firstly, we use 2-bit binary numbers (bi-serial) as the smallest unit of operation working in the mixed-signal mode to achieve arbitrary precision. This significantly reduces latency compared to the pure serial approaches. Secondly, we take the unique advantages of bi-serial (2-bit by 2-bit) multiplication and reduce the number of voltage bands that we need to differentiate from seven to four.

Different from viewing the whole OFDM system as a black box in the literature, the proposed receiving system is divided into two low-complexity neural networks (NNs). The first NN is designed for semi-blind channel estimation and the second NN recovers the original signals based on the channel state information (CSI) obtained from the first network. Simulation results show that this system offers a competitive accuracy for channel estimation. Specifically, our simulations show better robustness when a very small number of pilots are used compared with traditional channel estimation methods. With the help of the estimated CSI, the NN for signal detection converges within much fewer epochs than data-driven solutions. Due to fast convergence and small size of the NNs, this system can be trained within a short time to adapt to different channel models.

A differential shunt-feedback TIA (SF-TIA) is optimized to reach its minimum input-referred noise, with and without cross-coupled inverters at its output. The negative transconductance introduced at the TIA's output improves bandwidth, noise performance and vertical eye opening (VEO). Dynamic damping is introduced by adding a triode-region transistor with a time-varying bias voltage across the outputs which modulates the damping factor of the system from −0.42 to 3.5 each unit interval.

Operation at lower frequency could greatly extend lifetimes of small low-power Internet-of-Things devices such as battery-powered sensors operating primarily as transmitters. Unfortunately, physical size constraints and the Wheeler-Chu limit have greatly hindered utilization of VHF bands for mobile devices, where even a 200 MHz half-wave dipole is an unwieldy 0.75 m. However, recent advances in non-Foster impedance matching methods have overcome these limits. In addition, recent digital non-Foster methods are shown to closely resemble digital radio architectures, suggesting that these newer digital non-Foster methods can be readily adopted in new digital radio designs. Therefore, a novel digital non-Foster radio architecture is proposed, where digital non-Foster methods enable small devices in energy-efficient VHF bands while overcoming Wheeler-Chu antenna-size limits.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180893","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180893","","Impedance;Radio transmitters;Dipole antennas;Propagation losses;Digital communication;Receivers","","","","47","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a standard approach, the map-based localization is robust and fast; however, it is expensive to create and maintain a large-scale high-definition map. In this paper, we propose an online localization technique based on the vehicle-to-vehicle communication and traffic landmark detection; called collaborative localization. This can potentially serve as a new complement to the standard localization solutions. We theoretically show that multiple vehicles with multiple traffic landmarks would significantly improve the localization performance. We then propose a practical algorithm, which leverages graph matching to handle practical issues, such as traffic landmark association.

Termed as Mobile Industrial Internet-of Things (MI2oT) devices in this paper, a key requirement of these devices is to accurately estimate range and Doppler in various applications, in addition to data communication. Research efforts, therefore, include incorporating MI2-oT devices with high-data rate communications together with Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave Radar (FMCW) sensing capabilities. Range and Doppler sensing, in FMCW radars is undertaken by a two-stage Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which is computationally demanding. It is challenging to design baseband processing with FFTs that can be implemented as low computational hardware or application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) in MI2oT devices. This paper, presents a novel range and Doppler sensing technique based on Goertzel filtering, leading to considerable reduction in computations compared to the FFT. FMCW radar with Goertzel filtering and FFT are examined in three cases viz., sensing the range and velocity of a car, vibration and respiration monitoring. Simulation results show a computation reduction of the order of 6.3×, 7.7× and 8.1× in giga-operations per second (GOPS) for the three cases respectively. The reduced computations increase the feasibility of implementing range and Doppler sensing in MI2oT devices which have restricted computational resources.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180896","FFT;FMCW radar;Goertzel Filtering;IoT;sensing","Radar;Filtering;Doppler effect;Chirp;Robot sensing systems;Automobiles","","1","","14","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This has made chopper-stabilization the modality of choice for many recently published implementations. To tackle the issue of decreased input impedance, the auxiliary path boosting scheme can be used, which minimizes the amount of charge drawn from the electrode by precharging the input capacitors through a voltage buffer. However, the offset of the buffer translates to a deterministic amount of charge per time that is transfered to the electrodes and accelerates electrode aging. If blocking capacitors are used as a safety feature, the offset-induced charge can lead to a voltage drift due to charge accumulation, that slowly saturates the buffers. This paper presents a voltage buffer that uses a self-compensation scheme to reduce the time-averaged offset to sub − 20 μV, thereby minimizing excess charge.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180910","","Electrodes;Impedance;Capacitors;Boosting;Clocks;Resistance;Integrated circuit modeling","","2","","8","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To transfer power, an open-top ultrasonic transducer would be placed near the skin, the ultrasonic wave can power circuits on the tip of the catheter inside the patient. For the tracking system, transducers use ultrasonic backscattering and time-of-arrival to precisely locate the tip of the catheter. To show this concept will work in future applications, the two major components of the system were tested and validated using commercial off-the-shelf devices with air as medium. We were able to show a one-way 0.34mm localization resolution and track an object in two dimensions with 6.32mm accuracy on the x-axis and 4.27mm on the y-axis. Ultrasonic Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) was modeled using a linear rectangular array approximation via an open-source MATLAB Toolbox known as k-Wave.

It can record electrophysiological activity on up to 32 channels and stimulate with up to 4 optical channels using only commercial off the shelf (COTS) components. An embedded digital field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is used to allow real time digital separation of AP and LFP waveform and the recording of EMG.

The digital filters are optimized to reduce latency so the 32 channels can be time multiplexed on a single data path to decrease power consumption and optimize resource utilisation. Performing signal separation allows the compression of the AP and the decimation of the LFP/EMG. This reduces the amount of data to transmit by a factor of 7.77 (for a firing rate of 50 AP/second) and allow a higher channel count for both signals.

In this paper we propose to use the Sense Amp as a comparator to perform the digitization using a serial flash, implemented in memory. Flash ADCs require an ordered set of reference voltages to compare against the input to be digitized.

Traditional patch-based methods are not effective to deal with complex or non-repetitive structures. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have shown promising results for image inpainting. However, they usually generate contents with artificial boundaries, distorted structures or blurry textures. To handle this problem, we propose a novel image inpainting method based on wavelet transform attention model (WTAM). The wavelet transform decomposes features into multi-frequency sub-bands for extracting and transmitting deep information, and the attention mechanism enhances the ability of wavelet transform to capture significant detailed information in each level's subband images. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets (Paris StreetView, CelebA and CelebAMask-HQ) demonstrate that our method can not only synthesize sharp image structures but also generate fine-detailed textures in missing regions, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180927","","Feature extraction;Discrete wavelet transforms;Wavelet domain;Semantics;Wavelet packets","","3","","26","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Time-interleaving (TI) is one of the promising techniques for extending the synthesizable frequency and bandwidth of the DACs. However, timing mismatch errors in the sub-DAC clocks introduce spurious images in the TIDAC's Nyquist band, thus degrading the TIDAC's spurious-free-dynamic-range (SFDR) performance. Nonetheless, correction of the spurious images in TIDACs with more than 2 channels have been little studied. In this paper, we consider a 4-channel TIDAC and investigate its image generation mechanism. A pre-correction filter bank structure to correct for the images in the TIDAC's Nyquist band is presented and a weighted least squares (WLS) approach for optimizing the coefficients is introduced.

The most challenging type of image to perform extraction on is the panoramic image since it includes other parts of the patient's mouth, and structures lack explicit boundaries. The proposed method in this paper is the first automated teeth extraction system from dental panoramic images using evolutionary algorithms. First, the jaw is extracted from the main image. Then, upper and lower jaws are separated, followed by a genetic algorithm to detect teeth gap valleys.

The reuse of integrator for both ISDM and NS releases the demands of high-resolution multi-input comparator replaced by only a 2-input one, which also helps suppress the noise from comparator and clock to the top plate of capacitor digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) relatively. With the embedded ISDM, the gain of amplifier used in the finite impulse response (FIR) filter for NS is relaxed remarkably, and wider bandwidth (BW) as well as lower oversampling rate (OSR) is realized compared to those traditional NS-SAR ADCs.

In contrast to state-of-the-art analog DAC error corrections, the proposed adaptive body-biasing correction places the AUX-DACs outside of the feedback loop. Hence, the statically operating AUX-DACs enable a highly area- and power-efficient DAC linearization technique. Based on a detailed feedback DAC mismatch analysis, the required AUX-DAC resolution and range is deducted. In addition, potential kickback from the feedback DAC to the AUX-DACs as well as the AUX-DAC noise contribution to the total modulator noise are discussed on schematic level.

Two types of supervision information are regarded as negative label; the first type indicates that a sample definitely does not belong to a specific category, and the second indicates that two samples come from different views, and cannot have a one to one correspondence. By reasonably assuming that nearby points should have similar class indicators, the data labels are propagated under the negative label and the geometric structure revealed by both labeled and unlabeled points. Specifically, we predict one to one pair information by utilizing the neighbor information of samples, under the guidance of the negative pair label. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180979","Semi-supervised learning;Semi-paired learning;negative information;label propagation","Prediction algorithms;Gold;Semisupervised learning;Cats;Market research;Training;Machine learning","","","","29","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This issue can be resolved through the use of dedicated hardware platforms, like Field Programmable Gate Arrays and Graphical Processing Units, which are considered as expensive solutions. In this work, the challenge of accelerating stereo matching on low cost multicore platforms is tackled. We present a novel software implementation of a sparse Rank algorithm, that uses a modified Sum of Absolute Differences 1D box filtering algorithm in the correlation stage. Consequently, we reduce the number of computations and memory space needed for computing the disparity map. The system is implemented on a multicore Advanced Risc Machine platform (ODROID XU4). Experimental results show that the system is capable of achieveing a processing speed of 59 Frames Per Second for images of size 320×240 pixels with a disparity range of 20 pixels.

First we look at using Look Up Tables (LUT) to remove the multiplication operations and obviate the need of a multiplier. We compare the different tradeoffs of this approach in terms of accuracy versus LUT size and the number of operations and show that similar performance can be obtained with a comparable memory footprint as a full precision linear classifier, but without the use of any multipliers. Secondly we reduce the number of trainable model parameters by decomposing linear operators in neural networks as a product of sums of simpler linear operators which generalizes recently proposed deep learning architectures such as CNN, KFC, Dilated CNN, etc. We show that good accuracy on MNIST and Fashion MNIST can be obtained using a relatively small number of trainable parameters. In addition, since implementation of the convolutional layer is resource-heavy, we also consider an implementation in the transform domain that obviates the need for convolutional layers. We illustrate the tradeoff of varying the number of trainable variables and the corresponding error rate. As an example, by using this decomposition on a reference CNN architecture for MNIST with over 3 · 106 trainable parameters, we are able to obtain an accuracy of 98.44% using only 3554 trainable parameters.

Two respective processors for the overlap split and the connected component analysis (CCA) are the key components in a multi-touch detector. Exploiting the simplicity of typical intensity maps in practice, the two processors are first redesigned under a principle that every pixel is processed only once in a raster-scan order. More specifically, the concept of valley point is introduced, and a simple yet effective overlap-split scheme called valley-point division (VPD) is newly developed based on the concept. In addition, equivalent labels in the CCA are handled on the fly instead of being kept to be processed later, and the logics and memories for corner cases that never occur in practice are unloaded. Enabled by the redesign, subsequently, the two processors are integrated into one to concurrently conduct both the VPD and the CCA during the same raster scan. As a result, the proposed detector completes the whole detection procedure with a single raster scan of a map, and is exempted from a large memory required to hold an entire map. Implementation results in a 65-nm CMOS for a large panel of 400 × 250 sensors demonstrate that the proposed detector takes less than a half latency of the existing ones while occupying only 17% silicon area and consuming 52% power on average.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180986","Connected component analysis (CCA);connected component labeling (CCL);multi-touch detection;overlap split;touch-screen panel (TSP)","Detectors;Program processors;Process control;Business;Electrical engineering;Control engineering;Memory management","","","","0","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are essential to hyper-speed data storage, communications, and continued scaling of distributed storage. Sub-codewords, which are usually Reed-Solomon (RS) or BCH codewords, are nested to generate codewords of higher correction capabilities. If the decoding of individual sub-codewords fails, the higher-order syndromes from the nested codewords are utilized to correct more errors. GII decoder design faces many challenges. The major ones include: 1) high-speed nested decoding utilizing the higher-order syndromes; 2) efficient updating of higher-order syndromes after sub-codewords are corrected; 3) computation of nested syndromes and matrix inversion for converting them to higher-order sub-codeword syndromes; and 4) efficient architectures capable of addressing the variable correction capabilities of the nested codewords. This paper proposes novel algorithmic reformulations and architectural transformations to address each bottleneck. For an example, GII code that has the same rate and length as eight un-nested (255, 223) RS codes, the proposed GII decoder achieves more than seven orders of magnitude improvement in error-correcting performance with less than 30% area overhead compared to the RS decoder. With a critical path of seven XOR gates, the proposed decoder can easily achieve more than 40 GByte/s throughput.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180996","Error-correcting codes;generalized integrated interleaved codes;key equation solver;locally recoverable codes;nested decoding;Reed-Solomon codes;scalable Chien search;syndromes;Vandermonde matrix inversion","Decoding;Computer architecture;Memory;Computational efficiency;Matrix converters;Logic gates;Throughput","","","","0","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, its dynamic storage mechanism requires power-hungry refresh cycles to maintain data. This problem is aggravated due to the impact of Process-Voltage-Temperature (PVT) variations at deeply-scaled technology nodes and low voltages. In this paper, we present a GC-eDRAM with body-bias compensated readout, which is dynamically configured to extend the data retention time (DRT) of the memory under varying operating conditions. The proposed GC-eDRAM exploits the body-biasing capabilities of FD-SOI technology to adjust the switching threshold of the sense inverter under PVT variations. An additional, unbiased, sense inverter is added to provide a dual-sampling mechanism to the readout path, enabling error detection to further reduce design guard bands. An 8 kb GC-eDRAM with integrated body-bias compensated readout and error detection was implemented in 28 nm FD-SOI technology. Silicon measurements of the manufactured array demonstrate up-to 75% DRT improvement and up-to 86% energy savings under PVT and frequency variations compared to a conventional guard banded memory design.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180997","random access memory;circuits and systems;timing;gain-cell edram;data retention time","Random access memory;Inverters;Frequency measurement;Telecommunications;Nanoscale devices;Integrated circuits","","1","","0","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To facilitate a high-resolution multiplication as a part of the classifier predictions, ML features and feature weights are, respectively, fed to the back and front gate inputs of the individual IDG-FinFET transistors. A classifier that considers the decisions of the individual predictors is designed at 30 nm FinFET technology node and operates at 333 MHZ with nominal supply voltage of one volt. To evaluate the performance of the classifier, a reduced MNIST dataset is generated. The original resolution is reduced from 28×28 features to 9×9 features and the most important features are selected with sequential backward selection algorithm. The system is simulated in SPICE, exhibiting prediction accuracy of 90%, energy consumption of 25 pJ per classification (over four times lower than similar state-of-the-art classifiers), area of 1,365 μm2, and a stable response under a wide range of system variations.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9180998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9180998","Machine learning hardware;mixed-signal classifiers;double gate transistors;high resolution;high-dimensional data;multi-class classification;linear classifiers;logistic regression;FinFET devices","FinFETs;Machine learning;Logic gates;Energy resolution;MOSFET circuits;Topology","","","","0","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

GC-eDRAM achieves high memory density as it relies on a storage cell that can be implemented with as few as two transistors and that can be fabricated without additional process steps. However, since the performance of GC-eDRAMs relies on many interdependent variables, the optimization of the performance of these memories for the integration into their hosting system, as well as the design investigation of future GC-eDRAMs, prove to be highly complex tasks. In this context, modeling tools of memories are key enablers for the exploration of this large design space in a short amount of time. In this paper, we present GEMTOO, the first modeling tool that estimates timing, memory availability, bandwidth, and area of GC-eDRAMs. The tool considers parameters related to technology, circuits, and memory architecture and it enables the evaluation of architectural transformations as well as of advanced transistor-level effects, such as the increase of the access delay due to deterioration of the stored data. The timing is estimated with a maximum deviation of 15% from post-layout simulations in a 28nm FD-SOI technology for different memory sizes and architectures. Moreover, the measured random cycle frequency of a GC-eDRAM fabricated in 28nm CMOS bulk process is estimated with a 9% deviation when considering 6-sigma random process variations of the bitcells.

In this work, first we present a novel approach to add the training ability to a baseline DNN accelerator (inference only) by splitting the SGD algorithm into simple computational elements.

Then, the integer weights related to each neuron are tuned to reduce the hardware complexity in the time-multiplexed design avoiding a loss on the ANN accuracy in hardware. Also, at each layer of ANN, the multiplications of integer weights by an input variable at each time are realized under the shift-adds architecture using a minimum number of adders and subtractors. It is observed that the application of the post-training stage yields a significant reduction in area, latency, and energy consumption on the time-multiplexed designs including multipliers.

Impairments in analog quadrature modulator have a deleterious effect on the signal fidelity. Among the critical impairments, I/Q imbalance (gain and phase mismatches) deteriorates the residual sideband performance of the analog quadrature modulator degrading the error vector magnitude. Based on the theoretical mismatch analysis of the quadrature modulator, we propose a low-complexity I/Q imbalance extraction algorithm. After the parameter extraction, the transmitter is calibrated by imposing the counter imbalanced mismatch of the transmitter through the digital baseband. In comparison with existing I/Q imbalance calibration methods, the novelty of the proposed method lies in that: 1) only three spectrum measurements of the device-under-test are needed for extraction and calibration of gain and phase mismatches; 2) due to the blind nature of the calibration algorithm, the proposed approach can be readily applicable to an existing I/Q transmitter; 3) no extra hardware that degrades the calibration accuracy is required; and 4) due to the noniterative nature, the proposed method is faster and computationally more efficient than previously published methods.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181011","Calibration;image rejection;quadrature mismatch;quadrature modulation;residual sideband (RSB);single sideband;transmitter","Calibration;Transmitters;Amplitude modulation;Control engineering;Phase modulation;Parameter extraction","","","","0","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, modern neural interfaces need to record high resolution potentials from hundreds of neurons; this requires much higher data rates. While fast wireless communication is possible using existing standards such as WiFi, power consumption demands are far too high for IMDs. Short range inductive link based telemetry, in particular impulse-based systems such as pulse-harmonic modulation (PHM), have demonstrated transfer speeds of up to 20 Mbps with a small power budget. However, these systems require complex and precise circuits, making them potentially susceptible to inter-symbol-interference. This work presents a new method named Short-range Quality-factor Modulation (SQuirM), which retains the low power consumption and high data rate of PHM, while improving the resilience of the system and simplifying the circuit design.

Spatially-discrete time-continuous (SDTC) algorithms running on analog computers can be potentially faster and more energy-efficient than fully-discrete numerical solvers. The implementations of fully-discrete partial differential equation (PDE) solvers on high speed digital processors, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), take many clock cycles to compute a single temporal frame of the update equation and thus have relatively low equivalent bandwidths. Our approach is to directly implement temporal recursions in continuous-time by using analog circuits. Such circuits can have bandwidths that greatly exceed the equivalent bandwidths of GPUs. In particular, we propose two analog computing methods that compute the SDTC solutions to Maxwell's equations. In addition to Maxwell's equations, such platforms can be used to accelerate other hard computational problems that involve PDEs derived from continuous-time systems. In continuous-time in Laplace domain (CTLD) method (first approach), the spatial domain partial derivatives in the governing PDE are approximated using discrete finite differences, while applying the Laplace transformation along the time dimension. The resulting spatially-discrete time-continuous update equation is utilized to design an analog circuit that can compute the continuous-time solution. The all-pass delay approximate (APDA) method (second approach) replaces the discrete-time difference operators in the standard finite difference time domain (FDTD) cell (Yee cell) using continuous-time delay operators, which can be realized using analog all-pass filters. Both methods have been simulated using ideal analog circuits in Cadence Spectre for the Dirichlet, Neumann, and radiation boundary conditions. The performance of the proposed methods have been quantified using i) mean squared differences between the results and fully-discrete FDTD simulations, and ii) the noise to signal energy ratio. The CTLD and APDA methods are able to compute the solutions to Maxwell's equations with a noise energy to signal energy ratio γ better than −26 dB and −19 dB, respectively. Both methods have been extended to design analog circuits that compute the continuous-time solution of the 1-D and 2-D wave equations. The CTLD-based 1-D and 2-D analog wave equation solvers are able to compute the solutions with γ better than −72 dB and −60 dB, respectively. The APDA-based 1-D wave equation solver is simulated with a dominant-pole model (which better approximates the non-ideal circuit behavior) along with a propagation delay compensation technique. The non-ideal analog models compute the solution with a difference smaller than −13 dB (in terms of γ). Experimental results from a simplified board-level low-frequency implementation are also presented. The key challenges toward CMOS implementations of the proposed solvers are identified and briefly discussed with possible solutions.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181014","Maxwell's equations;Analog computing;Wave equation;All-pass filters","Maxwell equations;Analog circuits;Mathematical model;Propagation;Bandwidth;Time-domain analysis;Computational modeling","","3","","0","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analytical expressions for gain, NF, and input impedance of the proposed parametrically gain-boosted N-path BPF are derived using linear periodically time-variant (LPTV) network analysis and have been verified through simulations.

How is this possible? And how can we replicate this? A crucial clue comes from neuroscience: the brain is a complex physical system and the network topology of its neural circuitry is a determinant of its emergent collective properties. Indeed, as the brain's neural network is already entrained in its physical hardware, it clearly does not require an ANN software add-on to learn from natural data. Self-assembled nanowire networks with memristive junctions represent arguably the closest hardware architecture to real biological neural networks and are thus uniquely placed to demonstrate genuinely neuromorphic information processing. Here, we present preliminary results on polymer-coated silver nanowire networks. Their neuromorphic architecture (densely structured network topology, memristive switch junctions and efficient interconnect) gives rise to a rich repertoire of collective nonlinear dynamics manifested through adaptive current transport pathways. The potential for associative learning is demonstrated in a test protocol in which a nanowire network is stimulated by multiple electrodes mapped to different spatial patterns. The capacity to process information in the temporal domain is demonstrated via simulations of a reservoir computing implementation in which nanowire networks are shown to perform tasks such as time series prediction and handwritten digit recognition. Overall, their unique properties and neuromorphic information processing capabilities make nanowire networks promising candidates for emerging applications in cognitive devices in particular, at the edge.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181034","","Junctions;Training;Nanobioscience;Reservoirs;Neuromorphics;Task analysis;Information processing","","11","","20","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Regarding their analog characteristics, memristance decoder is, therefore, an essential part for every memristor-based system. As memristor is a temperature sensitive device, this work proposes a memristance decoder circuit with self-temperature calibration. Its main building block is a comparator which is based on current mode circuit to achieve high performance at low power. The design provides configurable precision based on the available energy and supports both synchronous and asynchronous schemes. Moreover, the VTEAM model is modified to include the temperature effect on the memristance in the analysis. The simulation results, based on UMC 65nm low-leakage CMOS technology, show the following comparator's characteristics: 1.70% maximum offset, 2.91ns worst case latency, 343MHz maximum frequency and 48.79fJ maximum energy per comparison. Monte Carlo simulation shows the metastable state in determining the memristor value. This can be solved by extending the clock period or applying a metastability resolver. The proposed memristor model reveals that memristance at high resistive state degrades quadratically with the rise of the temperature and at 85C nearly reaches the memristance of low resistive state.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181044","memristor;thermal effect;resistance comparator;memristance decoder;metastability","Decoding;Memristors;Temperature;Integrated circuit modeling;Uniform resource locators;Nanoscale devices;Biosensors","","","","0","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach, however, needs to respect the inter-frame prediction structure, which often suggests recursive, multi-step prediction with error propagation and accumulation in the temporal dimension. To tackle the issue, we refine the motion-compensated segmentation using inpainting. Our inpainting network incorporates guided non-local attention for long-range reference and pixel-adaptive convolution for ensuring the local coherence of the segmentation. A fusion step then follows to combine both the motion-compensated and inpainted segmentations.

Unlike conventional cameras with a fixed low sampling rate, retina-inspired spike camera can well record fast-moving scenes by continuously accumulating luminance intensity and firing spikes. To restore the captured high-speed motion scenes from spike data, several reconstruction methods have been proposed. A typical method utilizes two neighbouring spikes to infer the instantaneous luminance intensity. Although high temporal resolution imaging can be achieved, the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of reconstructions is generally unsatisfactory. For improving the SNR, some methods propose to average the spikes in big time window. However, the reconstructions may suffer from undesired motion blur, especially when there are objects moving very fast in scenes. To address this issue, we develop a new image reconstruction approach for potential retina-inspired spike camera to recover high-speed motion scenes. Specially, we take the motion of objects into consideration and exploit optical flow to align the scenes of different moments. After motion alignment, a filtering along motion trajectory can be employed to the signals to take the advantage of temporal correlations while not introducing undesired motion blur. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better visual quality than previous reconstruction schemes.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181055","","Image reconstruction;Cameras;Visualization;Signal to noise ratio;Optical imaging;Reconstruction algorithms;Correlation","","25","","13","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The leakage current, the sum of off-state current (IOFF) of OTS selectors, causes the voltage drop and increases the variation of sensing voltage (VSENSE) which is the electric potential difference between a selected bit line (BL) and a word line (WL). Eventually, the voltage drop reduces the sensing margin (SM). To compensate for the BL voltage drop, the proposed RVM reduces the VSENSE variation by applying an adaptive voltage to the selected WL. Thus, a sufficient SM is guaranteed. HSPICE simulation results with industry-compatible 65-nm model parameters show that the cross-point OTS-PRAM with the proposed RVM achieved a remarkable improvement in SM (from 105 mV to 395 mV) in high BL leakage current condition (51.3 uA).","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181076","Cross-point array;leakage current compensation;off-state current;ovonic threshold switch (OTS);phase change memory (PRAM);read voltage modulation (RVM)","Voltage measurement;Voltage control;Temperature measurement;Leakage currents;Phase change random access memory;Degradation;Threshold voltage","","2","","17","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Low active and standby power consumption is an indispensable design goal for devices, such as the read-only memory (ROM) for code storage, used in these systems. Sub-threshold (sub-Vt) designs can help accomplish the goal. A 90nm NAND-ROM achieved a state-of-the-art minimum supply voltage (Vmin) of 0.25V by using a source-line control scheme to reduce the impact of leakage and noise and using a code-inversion-based flag-table (CIB-FT) and a data-aware sensing reference (DASR) scheme for performance improvement. For advanced IoT sensing systems designed in a more advanced CMOS process with a more aggressive Vmin, more considerable leakage and higher PVT variations become the main design challenges of the sub-Vt ROM. In this paper, we first illustrate the design challenges and considerations to reach the goal of a Vmin of no higher than 0.25V for the state-of-the-art ROM redesigned in 40nm CMOS. We then propose new design techniques, including flag-table-free architecture and the new bit-line load and sense amplifier for meeting the higher stringent design specifications. Comparison results according to post-layout simulations show that the proposed 40nm ROM achieve a 17%, 16%, 43%, and 91% reduction in area, Vmin, active power, and standby leakage power, respectively, compared to the redesigned NAND-ROM.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181078","ROM;sub-Vt;IoT;sensing system;Vmin","Sensors;Read only memory;Simulation;Ions;Computer architecture;Logic gates;Leakage currents","","1","","3","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The following paper is a characterization of an experimental inkjet-printed sensor that circumvents the problem of rigidity by using a highly flexible substrate while also benefiting from low fabrication costs, low power usage, and environmental friendliness. The sensor is a 4 × 4 grid of Aluminum-doped Zinc Oxide nodes inkjet-printed on paper-based substrates. The tests performed show nodes are capable of responding to applied pressures of over 540 PSI. Notably, they exhibit sensitivity to heat and humidity without shielding measures, making it more useful for physical therapy. Power usage of the device is shown to be as low as 5 μW. Silver nanoparticle ink was chosen as electrical routing between the Zinc Oxide and data collection scheme. The analog signal is connected through ELVIS II+ analog pins, where a MATLAB script retrieves and stores the data for visual analysis.

Energy-efficient, low-area, and biocompatible artificial neurons are key ubiquitous components of any large scale neural systems. Previous CMOS-based neurons implementations suffer from scalability drawbacks and cannot naturally mimic the analog behavior. Memristor and phase-changed neurons have variability-induced instability drawbacks, and usually rely on additional CMOS circuitry. However, graphene, despite its ballistic transport, inherently analog nature, and biocompatibility, which provide natural support for biologically plausible neuron implementations has only been considered for Boolean logic implementations. In this paper, we propose an ultra-compact, all graphene-based nonlinear Leaky Integrate-and-Fire spiking neuron. By means of SPICE simulations, we validate its basic functionality and investigate the output spikes response under stochastic noisy input spike trains with a variable firing rate, from 20 to 200 spikes per second. Simulation results indicate neuron robustness to noisy scenarios, and neuronal output firing regularity. The small area and the low energy consumption, due to 200 mV supply voltage operation, can benefit the implementation of large scale neural networks, and the biologically plausible operating conditions (e.g., 2 ms and 100 mV spike duration and amplitude), can promote the interfacebility of graphene-based artificial neurons with biological counterparts.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181092","Neuromorphic Computing;Integrate-And-Fire Neuron;Graphene;GNR","Graphene;Logic gates;Neuromorphics;Electric potential","","9","","18","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This process becomes even more difficult for recurrent networks, where exploding gradient phenomena can further destabilize the training process. In this paper, we propose an adaptive data-driven initialization approach for recurrent photonic neural networks. The proposed method is activation-agnostic, while it takes into account the actual distribution of the data used to train the network, overcoming a number of significant limitations of existing approaches.

Unfortunately, with the downscaling of CMOS technology, modern ADCs trade off speed, power and accuracy. Recently, memristive neuromorphic architectures of four-bit ADC/DAC have been proposed. Such converters can be trained in real-time using machine learning algorithms, to break through the speed-power-accuracy trade-off while optimizing the conversion performance for different applications. However, scaling such architectures above four bits is challenging. This paper proposes a scalable and modular neural network ADC architecture based on a pipeline of four-bit converters, preserving their inherent advantages in application reconfiguration, mismatch self-calibration, noise tolerance, and power optimization, while approaching higher resolution and throughput in penalty of latency. SPICE evaluation shows that an 8-bit pipelined ADC achieves 0.18 LSB INL, 0.20 LSB DNL, 7.6 ENOB, and 0.97 fJ/conv FOM.

This paper presents a circuit simulation-based performance assessment of memristor networks as SPP solvers. A previous methodology is extended to support weighted directed graphs. We use memristor device models with fundamentally different switching behavior, to check their suitability for such applications.

We consider a new class of maps constructed with this technique, the piecewise monotonic hat maps, and present an algorithm for selecting the map parameters to achieve simultaneous and independent prescription of the invariant density and multimodal power spectrum characteristics. This approach to solving the generalized inverse Frobenius-Perron problem is demonstrated by constructing several ergodic maps with the beta invariant density as well as unimodal and bimodal power spectra with distinct mode center frequencies and bandwidths.

To alleviate this computational burden, a novel KLMS based on a sparse Nyström method (SNKLMS) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Unlike NysKLMS using the k-means sampling to obtain k centroids from input data, the proposed SNKLMS algorithm first divides input data into several clusters, and then selects k centroids from the obtained clusters equally. According to the relation between the Gaussian kernel and the distance of different clusters, partial submatrices in the low-rank matrix of SNKLMS can be omitted to further reduce the operations of multiplication and addition, and thus a sparse low-rank matrix is obtained. Simulations on the channel equalization and chaotic time-series prediction validate the superiorities of SNKLMS.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181116","Nyström method;sparsification;k-means;kernel least mean square;Gaussian kernel;submatrices","Kernel;Sparse matrices;Signal processing algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Training data","","2","","25","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, issues such as threshold drop across the single-channel pass transistors and high sensitivity to process variations have prevented the use of PTL in advanced nanometer technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel logic family named Dual Mode Pass Logic (DMPL), which allows for high speed and low power consumption while maintaining robustness down to the sub-threshold voltage region. The DMPL effectively combines PTL to reduce energy and power consumption along with the flexibility of Dual Mode Logic (DML) to switch to a speed improved operating mode according to the system requirement. Simulation analysis performed on basic NOR/NAND gates implemented in 16 nm Finfet technology demonstrates that DMPL can reduce energy and power by 33% and 42% as compared to logically equivalent static CMOS design. Moreover, running frequency of a DMPL circuit can exceed that of its static CMOS counterpart by 84% when speed is mandatory. Additionally, DMPL gates demonstrate similar robustness as static CMOS implementations under process and temperature variations at lower supply voltages.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181127","16 nm;Dual Mode Logic (DML);low power;Pass Transistor Logic (PTL);energy efficiency;logic family","Logic gates;Transistors;Delays;Robustness;Fish;Power demand;Capacitance","","3","","11","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional EDA tools could not achieve balance between accuracy and simulation effort for statistical timing analysis in subthreshold region. Many researches have been devoted to statistical timing model to reveal the relation between delay variation and process variation with physical insight. However, the statistical correlation of gate delay in circuit path is hard to capture and not considered appropriately in most prior works. In this paper, a statistical timing model for subthreshold circuit is proposed with the consideration of local process variation and correlated variation from adjacent gates, which is established by deriving variance models for gate delay and output waveform analytically for fast and slow input waveform separately, so that the path delay variation can be translated from the accumulation of the correlated gate delays with input slew to a linear combination of independent step input delays. The proposed model was verified under the process of TSMC28nm technology at the subthreshold supply voltage with the estimation error of less than 6% for circuit path delay variation in benchmark ISCAS99 compared with Monto Carlo simulation results, which outperforms prior works with 5∼10X accuracy increase and acceptable simulation cost.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181136","Subthreshold;variation;correlation;statistic timing model","Delays;Logic gates;Integrated circuit modeling;Threshold voltage;Computational modeling;Analytical models","","3","","13","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spatial row-wise noise in an image particularly is caused by pixel array power supply coupling. Common noise injection from a fluctuating power supply during pixel readout causes horizontal stripe noise because all signals in a row are affected by the noise simultaneously. By integrating an output capacitor-less low-dropout (LDO) regulator on chip to directly supply a regulated power to the imager pixel array exclusively, it is possible to reduce fixed-pattern row-wise noise considerably so that the row-stripe noise becomes invisible entirely. The LDO circuit uses internal inherent pixel array parasitic capacitances along with an integrated capacitor multiplier circuit to eliminate the need for an off-chip capacitor and thus isolates the pixel array from the external board components such as bond-wire, pad, and board traces. The LDO was designed and fabricated in 0.13 μm − 2P4M CMOS image sensor process and was implemented within a five-megapixel visible-light CMOS imager to prove the functionality and performance. Experimental data are included and shown that the row-wise noise is reduced by more than factor of five, making it negligible (and invisible) compare to the temporal pixel noise.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181141","Low-Noise CMOS Imager;Output Capacitor-less Low-Dropout Regulator;Fixed-Pattern Noise","Regulators;Capacitors;Capacitance;System-on-chip;CMOS image sensors;Layout;Logic gates","","3","","5","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A novel loss function is used in a semi-supervised fashion for the model to learn how to generate effective placements that follow topological constraints instead of simply trying to copy devices' locations from some pre-existing labeled dataset of placement solutions. Thus, in addition to eliminating the need for a large dataset of placed sizing solutions for training, the model generalizes better and outputs better layouts for solutions outside the training set. Moreover, one step further is taken towards a model that can predict the placement of different circuit topologies by supporting different encodings (with different number of devices) on the input layer of the artificial neural networks, ultimately fostering an opportunity to reuse incomplete legacy layout information.

Training algorithms play an important role in neural networks. Gradient-based algorithms are popularly used in the training of neural networks. They can be broadly classified into first and second-order methods. While first-order methods are simple and low in computational complexity, they are slow in convergence when applied to highly non-linear problems. Incorporating second order curvature information has shown to significantly improve convergence despite its high computational cost.

Analog sub blocks used within the system are modelled using SystemVerilog. Block level verification is done by performing equivalence checks between Analog schematics and behavioral models with the help of self-checking testbenches. The entire process of block level verification is well automated by means of script-based regressions. System level design constitutes of both analog as well as digital blocks. Traditional mixed mode simulations are time consuming which is mainly due to the huge netlist generated. This limits the number of test scenarios that can be verified. In system level simulations, the above-mentioned drawback can be resolved by choosing between transistor level schematic view or behavioral model view for the analog sub blocks based on the test case targeted. Automation of analog block level verification using regressions reduces the total debug time by 99% which ensures that more test scenarios are covered. Assertions in system level verification are used to check the integrity of analog to digital interface signals.

The proposed architecture implements the AOP multiplication algorithm in three stages, which are reduction network, AND network (multiplication), and three input XOR tree (accumulation), while state-of-the-art implementations distribute reduction, multiplication and accumulation operations in a systolic array. The optimization reduces the overall number of sequential instances and provides lower pipeline latency compared to literature. This leads to the reduction of power dissipation and area for a targeted system clock frequency. Both the previously reported and the proposed architectures have been implemented in Verilog for three different and relevant binary field sizes using TSMC 130-nm standard cell library from Artisan Components, and have been synthesized with a 100 MHz system clock frequency target using the Cadence Genus Synthesis tool. The proposed architecture offers 23%, 41%, and 20% reduction in average leakage, dynamic power, and area, respectively, compared to state of the art. The pipelined latency advantage can be translated to further power dissipation reduction by targeting a lower clock frequency in applications where single AOP multiplication execution time is more important than pipeline throughput. Thus, the proposed architecture is better suited for energy-efficient portable systems, including wireless sensors.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181179","Galois field multiplier;synthesis;irreducible;low-power;area-efficient;all-one polynomial (AOP);elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)","Computer architecture;Clocks;Elliptic curve cryptography;Wireless sensor networks;Registers;Logic gates;Power dissipation","","3","","25","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is demonstrated that the RNG output bitstream satisfies NIST 800-22 statistical tests of randomness without any need for post-processing and the proposed RNG can provide high data throughput. Furthermore, the proposed RNG uses less number of components compared to previously reported TERO based RNGs, thus enabling lower power consumption and smaller footprint. Additionally, the proposed RNG is subjected to correlation based cryptanalysis study. In classical ring oscillator (RO) based RNGs, the ring oscillators are required to be placed at a distance from each other to avoid locking phenomenon that may occur due to coupling between adjacent ROs. This study demonstrates that unlike classical RO based RNGs, the proposed RNG is insensitive to locking phenomenon and TERO structures are not required to be placed way from each other.

First, a paralleled constant-throughput scheme is designed for LLL algorithm. Then, greedy algorithm is adopted on this scheme to select the most urgent iterations for each stage. This selecting criterion outperforms others in that numerous iterations can be concurrently selected to reduce latency, and that the two factors of LLL potential and MIMO detection strategy are comprehensively considered by this criterion to improve bit-error-rate (BER) performance. Simulation indicates that the PGLLL can realize a comparable performance to the non-greedy algorithm and LLL algorithm with less iterations. Finally, this brief is the first to propose a hardware architecture with greedy LLL algorithm. This architecture is implemented with 65-nm 1P9M CMOS technology, which can work at a maximum frequency of 625 MHz to process 16×16 complex-valued matrices every 16 clocks. The latency is 362 ns. Comparison indicates that the proposed PGLLL architecture is superior to other existing works in terms of throughput and latency performance.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181195","","MIMO communication;Hardware;Computer architecture;Greedy algorithms;Semiconductor device modeling;CMOS technology;Clocks","","","","11","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The effect of noise and harmonics on estimation accuracy of these five techniques are analyzed and validated through simulation.

By maintaining pixel-to-pixel luminance uniformity, it addresses not only image sticking issues but also leads to a lifetime extension of the OLED pixels. Especially for large-sized OLED panels, it is important to understand the noise contributions from the analog front-end of the compensation circuitry. Noise contributions for each component are thus analyzed for maximizing the overall compensation performance. The analysis results show that the noise from the driving TFT and the display panel's parasitics dominate the total noise and that reducing the noise bandwidth can be an effective noise mitigation strategy.

Recent studies have successfully simulated the mechanism of the neuron feedback and developed corresponding speech enhancement algorithms for hearing applications. These algorithms apply time-varying attenuation to hearing applications by reducing the gain in each frequency band over time. The speed of gain reduction is characterized by a time constant. In hearing applications, it is known that speech intelligibility is related to the gain regulating time constant. However, the effect of the time constant on enhancement performance is unclear. This paper studies its effect on speech intelligibility in hearing aids by incorporating a time constant variable speech enhancement algorithm modified from an existing neuron feedback model into a hearing aid model. The study demonstrates intelligibility improvement of over 30% at SNR between 5 and 10 dB.

It is therefore quite natural to adapt the 2D saliency prediction methods for 360-degree images. To achieve this, it is necessary to project the 360-degree image to 2D plane. However, the existing projection techniques introduce different distortions, which provides poor results and makes inefficient the direct application of 2D saliency prediction models to 360-degree content. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a new framework for effectively applying any 2D saliency prediction method to 360-degree images. The proposed framework particularly includes a novel convolutional neural network based fusion approach that provides more accurate saliency prediction while avoiding the introduction of distortions. The proposed framework has been evaluated with five 2D saliency prediction methods, and the experimental results showed the superiority of our approach compared to the use of weighted sum or pixel-wise maximum fusion methods.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181229","Saliency prediction;Head movement;360 image;CNN;Cubemap projection;Fusion","Two dimensional displays;Head;Distortion;Training;Predictive models;Image coding","","3","","28","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a new residual block is proposed with a view of generating a rich set of features extracted at different scales and levels. The development of the proposed block is carried out using two distinct strategies, the first one focussing on generating features directly in two different scales, whereas the second one aims at generating multi-scale features indirectly by extracting them from two different hierarchical levels of abstraction.

This paper intends to represent the audience's attention transfer mechanism by attractive objects (key object) and proposes a key object detection network based on temporal reinforcement learning (RL). Temporal RL means our model structure using LSTM to output RL reward values dynamically. In a sense, it avoids formal reward setting may cause the RL result does not achieve expectation. In order to mark the object that attracts the audience's attention in successive switching video clips, our method keeps an eye of the attractive object by iterating the value of temporal RL strategy. The proposed model can detect multiple key objects simultaneously with the help of a temporal RL strategy that analyses the attention transfer. Specifically, the spatial features and temporal features, extracted by the ensemble convolution networks, are sent into the RL model to represent the objects, corresponding motions and less relative backgrounds. Google AVA [24] dataset, annotate the position and action of the main characters among many existing objects, are selected as the experiment dataset. Compared with other models, the results show that the proposed method can continuously focus on the attractive objects in the sequenced fragments.

This deviation in sensors' response is termed as drift. The drift of sensors is a challenging issue that limits the use of sensors over longer periods of time because the pattern recognition and classification systems fail to recognize the deviated response of sensors. To address this problem, this paper proposes the use of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) based Random Forests (RF) for compensation of small-scale drift in gas sensors. The proposed method is evaluated for the classification of six volatile compounds and is compared with multiple state-of-the-art classifiers and feature selection techniques using a benchmark dataset publicly available online. The results depict that the RF-RFE combination outperforms the other classifiers and feature selection techniques.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181246","Artificial Olfaction;Electronic Nose System;Random Forests;Recursive Feature Elimination;Sensors Drift","Feature extraction;Gas detectors;Radio frequency;Support vector machines;Testing;Forestry","","3","","16","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An event is triggered when the pixel has a brightness change. In spatio-temporal space, those events will form an event cloud, which has specific 3D geometry to capture the dynamic scene. To analyze the event cloud, previous works usually convert event streams into frame-based images which did not fully utilize its 3D geometry in the spatio-temporal event space. In this work, we propose to recognize the spatio-temporal 3D event clouds for gesture recognition using Dynamic Graph CNN (DGCNN) which directly takes 3D points as input and is successfully used for 3D object recognition. We adapt DGCNN to perform action recognition by recognizing 3D geometry features in spatio-temporal space of the event data.

Consequently, effects of the memory bandwidth bottleneck are reduced. Dedicated Multiplication and Accumulation (MAC) cores have been used in the experiments presented in this paper. The correct functionality of the proposed method is verified through Modelsim simulations.

Various libraries such as Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) exist that provide API interfaces to highly tuned, hardware-specific implementations. Applications such as deep learning push the limits of what is possible from these subroutines by necessitating unique optimizations like lowering numeric precision and data type bit-width, exploiting resiliency, and removing redundancy. Hardware plays a considerable role in the performance of a subroutine because of the inherent layout of memory and arithmetic structures such as the SIMD processors found in general CPU and GPU architectures. FPGAs play a unique role in this space because the reconfigurable circuits and routing provide a pipelined architecture capable of both SIMD and MIMD-like architectures. Within a pipeline, the capability of accelerating operations on FPGA through low-bit and fine-grained designs is typically only seen in ASICs. In this paper, we provide an overview of an OpenCL based GEMM accelerator design that exploits sparsity and compression to persist data in FPGA on-chip, fine-grained SRAM. The design includes support for successive GEMMs with added activation functions, making it suitable for some machine learning applications. Results are measured running on Intel's Arria 10 GX 1150 FPGA.

Machine Learning (ML) is a growing trend in determining yield as a complex function of multiple input variables. Aeroponics is one of the efficient sustainable farming methods and allows all season farming despite hostile outdoors growing environment. In this paper, yield prediction in aeroponics is studied using ML. We have compared and analyzed three popular supervised ML methods — Dense Neural Network (DNN), Random Forest based on decision trees (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Air quality and water quality measurements including temperature, humidity, CO2, pH and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are used for yield prediction. Other static inputs such as number of days before and after transplant are also used. Six crops are studied (garlic chives, basil, red chard, rainbow chard, arugula, and mint). DNN performs particularly well with the prediction. The root mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2) are calculated to estimate the efficiency of the method. Mean square error and R2 score of DNN are 0.10 and 0.67, RF follows DNN correctness with MSE and R2 of 0.12 and 0.62, and SVR achieves 0.18 and 0.45 respectively, all of these values over the validation dataset. In addition to individual models, the two top performing models are combined as an ensemble model to improve overall performance, which shows an average R2 score over the whole dataset divided by crop of 0.81.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181283","","Radio frequency;Agriculture;Training;Predictive models;Poles and towers;Temperature measurement;Neural networks","","4","","11","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such infectious disease is the Bovine Viral Diarrhoea. It is present worldwide, impacting financially within the beef and dairy industry. Currently, a BVD eradication programme consists of sending potentially infected samples to laboratories for analysis. This can be a time consuming process, thus enabling the opportunity of a possible disease to spread to other animals. This paper will report a microfluidic cartridge that allows electrochemical sensors to migrate from lab to field, using a straightforward, low-cost rapid prototyping method of a microfluidic system. Once the sample is placed into the cartridge it is subsequently inserted in a handheld console that will transmit results via Bluetooth to a phone app. The fabrication method employed to achieve this goal, is dependent on the utilisation of a desktop vinyl cutter. This machine facilitates a rapid prototyping method which can, with the use of double-sided pressure sensitive (PSA) material; consistently achieve microchannels with a minimum width of 200 μm. The microfluidic platform is assembled using PSA and PMMA (Poly (methyl methacrylate)) centred on a chip, which in turn consists of 6 electrochemical sensors. This process subsequently performs faradaic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry to detect the disease. A microfluidic design and full assembly is presented, using this rapid prototyping method. Due to its ease of fabrication, the entire process, from materials to testing, can be completed speedily to provide a leak-free microfluidic platform utilising inexpensive equipment.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181284","Bovine viral diarrhoea;electrochemical sensor;microfluidics;PSA;Hydrodynamics;micro-channels","Microfluidics;Sensors;Fabrication;Microchannels;Rapid prototyping;Diseases;Blades","","1","","10","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To conduct a successful application for ideal results, the broth concentration (the phytosanitary product is diluted in water) should be determined depending on the volume of vegetation of the fruit trees. In small orchards, this calibration is only done once per year, and is determined for the most voluminous trees in the orchard. This results in excessive doses of pesticides sprayed to all the other trees, that have lower vegetative volume. This excessive application not only has an increase in the cost of the fruits, but and can also pose potential risks for the environment and/or consumers. An adaptable system which can be used with common sprayer already employed in the orchards, capable of determining the Tree Row Volume (TRV) in real time and reducing the amount of product would be a solution to reduce phytosanitary application at a reduced cost. LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology can be used to measure length in the farm environment and has had a huge reduction in cost in the last few years, mainly for its use in autonomous cars.

However, there is still a big need to develop holistic solutions considering the entire food value chain where food and health stakeholders meet in consensus. This paper presents an innovative reflection of this holistic approach with specific interest on two aspects: (1) Combat with diabetes and (2) Food, but especially dessert, design and production processes; considering patient's or eater's preferences and health constraints cordially for better personalized medicine and nutrition. The proposed case study presents an integrated solution that is composed of a combined food, diabetes and dessert design ontology for more comprehensive and structured data analysis, IoT-enabled diabetes monitoring, VR-enabled dessert design and production for better cognitive enjoyment and participative virtual market for diversified access to food stakeholders.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181297","","Diabetes;Ontologies;Stakeholders;Semantics;Obesity;Monitoring","","","","20","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here we present a simple pre-processing method and the evaluation of three segmentation algorithms applied to cheese quality control by detecting and segmenting eyes in optical images of cheeses. Algorithms employed were: circle detection using Hough transform, thresholding and contour detection, blob detection and watershed. Segmentation results were contrasted with the same images, but previously segmented by an expert. Results showed that up to 75 % of eyes in cheese images were correctly detected and segmented using the proposed procedure.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181298","quality control;food processing;segmentation algorithms","Image segmentation;Dairy products;Shape;Quality control;Blob detection;Standards;Chemical engineering","","1","","5","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If the first one is considered as an excellent edible one, and its harvest generates mycological cross-border fairs between towns in Spain and Portugal, the ingestion of the second one produces the so-called late phalloidin syndrome, which can lead to the death of the consumer. Both have a very similar morphology, especially in their first stage of growth when their volva begins to open. This work studies the possibility of developing dedicated low-consumption, portable electronic nose devices capable of chemically supporting the odour differentiation made by collectors, industries and retailers, between the dangerous A. verna and the delicious A. ponderosa.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181299","electronic nose;edible mushrooms;poisonous mushrooms","Electronic noses;Gas detectors;Industries;Prototypes;Artificial neural networks;Bluetooth","","","","9","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fundamental components of the system are a waveguide, containing TX and RX antennas, and an electronic circuit, generating the electromagnetic waves and elaborating data, driven by a microcontroller (MCU). This system was previously tested on samples created in laboratory, but a study of system behavior in environmental conditions was missing. Therefore, acquisition of measurements and samples were conducted on real soil, and these data were used to obtain a good calibration model between spectra and soil moisture values. Calibration coefficients were used to implement the moisture calculation directly in the MCU, obtaining a non-invasive and stand-alone system. The architecture shows promising results and prove the capability of electromagnetic waves to perform accurate and fast silty clay loam moisture assessments on a real environment.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181300","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181300","soil moisture;Partial Least Square Regression;waveguide spectroscopy;microwave","Moisture;Soil moisture;Soil measurements;Calibration;Moisture measurement;Predictive models","","2","","16","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A large number of innovative sensors able to measure the water content and, thus, the hydration condition of grapes is deployed in the vineyard. The sensing mechanism is based on the transduction of relevant parameters acquired directly from the plant and not, as usually done, from the environment (e.g. soil). The sensor data are collected by a set of sensor nodes able to send data over long distances to a central hub which uploads the data to the cloud making the remote monitoring of the field possible. Trained operators will, thus, be able to implement irrigation strategies based on the actual state of the plant sampled with a high temporal and spatial density. This technological platform makes possible the implementation of deficit irrigation practices useful to save water and optimize production but also to properly drive the final characteristics of the grapes and of the wine. The platform requires minimal maintenance and its installation does not interfere with regular farming activities.","2158-1525","978-1-7281-3320-1","10.1109/ISCAS45731.2020.9181301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9181301","","Water resources;Stress;Biosensors;Pipelines;Irrigation","","3","","4","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
