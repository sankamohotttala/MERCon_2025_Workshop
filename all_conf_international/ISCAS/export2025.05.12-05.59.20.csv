"A 50-MHz Bandwidth and 50.6-dBm OOB-IIP3 Transimpedance Amplifier Based on a Three-Stage Pseudo-Differential OTA","C. Tao; L. Lei; Z. Hong; Y.

It's based on an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). To tolerate blockers, the TIA must exhibit excellent in-band (IB) and out-of-band (OOB) linearity, which in turn requires OTAs with high BW and gain. Traditional two-stage OTAs struggle to achieve this under low power consumption (PC), so this paper employs a three-stage OTA. A pseudo-differential structure without the tail current source is used to accommodate low supply voltages (Vdd). Differential-mode (DM) stability relies on feedforward (FF) compensation within the OTA and zero compensation in the feedback network. Common mode (CM) is stabilized by five different common mode rejection (CMR) techniques. The circuit is designed and simulated in a 40 nm low power (LP) CMOS technology with a Vdd of 1.2V. The post-layout simulation results show that when IM3 is set to 30 MHz, the TIA's IB and OOB IIP3 reach 31.6 dBm and 50.6 dBm, respectively. The minimum input-referred noise (IRN) is 5.14 $\mathbf{nV}/\sqrt{Hz}$. The corresponding FoM value is as high as 186.3 dBJ-1, exceeding all previous designs. The chip consumes 10.4 mW of power and occupies only 0.016mm2.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181693","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181693","Transimpedance amplifier;surface acoustic wave (SAW)-less receiver;three-stage;pseudo-differential;feedforward;common mode rejection;high linearity","5G mobile communication;Simulation;Linearity;Bandwidth;Tail;Receivers;Stability analysis","","1","","10","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are also some attempts to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle it. However, most existing neural network-based methods perform poorly in generalization and we need to train a specific model for each degradation situation. Besides, the sampling mask which represents the positions of the sampled pixels is not used effectively in these methods. To address the problems, we propose an optimization-inspired network called RRSNet based on our derivation of the iterative optimization formulas for RRS. In our method, we design a CNN with two encoders and one decoder for training, setting up a flexible and effective prior. To make the most of the sampling information, we concatenate the degraded image with the mask and input them into one encoder for better generalization. Then we split the pixels into two groups according to the mask and extract their features as the input of another encoder. Experiments demonstrate that our RRSNet with the mask input can handle various sampling ratios using only one trained model and achieve the best restoration performance among all comparison methods.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182150","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072009,22127807); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFF0900501); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182150","Image restoration;optimization;pixel sampling;image inpainting;deep neural network","Training;Neural networks;Feature extraction;Image restoration;Decoding;Convolutional neural networks;Iterative methods","","","","20","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel test generation method to accelerate assertion coverage using surrogate logic model. A surrogate logic model is used to represent an approximate relationship between an internal signal and related input signals, which is derived from simulation results by using machine learning technology. With surrogate logic model, we transfer the test generation for assertion coverage problem to a random sampling problem and solve it by the state-of-the-art sampling techniques.

The drain current $(I_{\mathbf{D}})$ increases with the reverse $V_{\text{BS}}$, and then saturates. This occurs as the occupancy probability and the band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) generation initially increase with the reverse body bias and remain unaltered from any further increase in $\boldsymbol{V}_{\mathbf{BS}}$. Therefore, the occupancy probability in the source valance band plays a vital role in determining the modulation of $\boldsymbol{I}_{\mathbf{D}}$ with $\boldsymbol{V}_{\mathbf{BS}}$. The reverse $V_{\text{BS}}$ at which the drain current attains a maximum is defined as $V_{\text{BSAT}}$, and it changes almost linearly with the gate bias $(V_{\text{GS}})$. We have proposed a novel physics-based model to investigate the dependence of $\boldsymbol{V}_{\mathbf{BSAT}}$ ‘ on $V_{\text{GS}}$. An increase of 40-60% in $\boldsymbol{V}_{\mathbf{D}}$ with the reverse $\boldsymbol{V}_{\mathbf{BS}}$ is also observed. Forward VBS modulates the value of BTBT generation and $\boldsymbol{I}_{\mathbf{D}}$ to a small extent. An incremental change in subthreshold slope and OFF -current is observed for the target device.

However, it requires multiple forward & backward passes through the model. Thus, compared to a single forward-pass inference, there is a significant computational overhead to generate the explanation which hinders real-time XAI. This work addresses the aforementioned issue by accelerating IG with a hardware-aware algorithm optimization. We propose a novel non-uniform interpolation scheme to compute the IG attribution scores which replaces the baseline uniform interpolation. Our algorithm significantly reduces the total interpolation steps required without adversely impacting convergence.

Supported by reference picture resampling (RPR) in Versatile Video Coding (VVC), which enables resolution changes without introducing an intra-coded frame, it is possible to adjust picture resolutions to adapt to the required bit-rate. However, few rate control algorithms with resolution changes have been explored for VVC. Therefore, we propose a $\lambda$-domain rate control algorithm with resolution changes in this paper. In the proposed rate control scheme, the coding resolution of one frame is determined based on the property of the frame. To make the rate control scheme adaptive to mixed resolutions, the rate control parameters of the full resolution and the low resolution are updated separately. Furthermore, $\lambda$ and QP of the frames with different resolutions are unified to obtain appropriate coding parameters. Simulation results show that a BD-rate coding gain about 3.7% on average can be achieved with the reduction of computational complexity. Besides, negligible bitrate error can be observed at both sequence and frame level.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181951","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62031013,62025101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181951","rate control;$\lambda$-domain;resolution changes;VVC","Video coding;Circuits and systems;Simulation;Bit rate;Distortion;Control systems;Encoding","","1","","19","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reduced redundancy is accomplished by utilizing approximate modules, hence requiring substantially different designs for the decision hardware for generating an output. The proposed schemes deal with a single erroneous data word generated by a module (in the presence of single and multiple bit errors) using three modules as inputs to the decision hardware of the RPA. Different from RPRs found in the technical literature, the proposed RPAs operate using only logic operations (so no involved as decision hardware). The probability of providing an exact data word at the output of the RPA under the above error conditions is analytically found; the provided simulation results show that the difference between simulated and analytical probabilities is at most 5%. Circuit based metrics (such as delay, power dissipation, and area) of the proposed designs are simulated and compared with RPR; the proposed designs outperform RPR in all metrics.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181543","Reduced Precision Approximation;Reduced Precision Redundancy;Error Tolerance;Decision Circuits;Modular Redundancy","Measurement;Circuits and systems;Simulation;Redundancy;Reliability engineering;Hardware;Power dissipation","","","","13","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In SMASH architectures, this relaxed timing enables an NC analog-to-digital converter (ADC) architecture. Unlike state-of-the-art solutions, which require an analog unit delay at the ADC's input to achieve these relaxed requirements, the presented bandpass approach renders this analog delay and the respective input capacitor unnecessary.

In this paper, we instead propose a Deep-Learning (DL)-based image transformation method, named SEM2GDS, which transforms a SEM image into its GDS image and produce shapes with sharp corners. This allows direct comparison between a transformed SEM image and the original GDS image for modification detection.

Specifically, the basin of attraction gets decreased and more sensitive to parameter changes. The complex bifurcation behavior behind these changes is revealed via the numerical continuation.

Although much progress has been made to improve the quality of HLS it is often reported that the generated RTL code from HLS leads to larger circuits as compared to hand optimized Verilog or VHDL. To measure the gap between hand optimized RTL and automatically generated RTL from HLS, periodic studies are presented were the authors manually optimize designs in RTL, re-write the functionality in C and then compare the quality of the generated RTL code. This is useful, but not very scalable as it is only possible to do this for a small number of designs. Moreover, the result from HLS is highly dependent on the synthesis options used, typically in the case of HLS, these have the form of pragmas (comments) that allow to control how to mainly synthesize arrays (e.g., RAM or registers), loops (e.g., unroll, partially, not unroll) and functions (e.g., inline or not). To address this, in this work we present an RTL to C compiler that generates synthesizable C code for HLS combined with an auto-tuner to automatically find HLS constraints such that the generated RTL code from HLS is as close as possible in terms of area and performance to the original manually optimized RTL code. This allows to directly compare the quality of the generated RTL code by further synthesizing these into equivalent gate netlist.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181987","","Codes;VHDL;Circuits and systems;Random access memory;Syntactics;Logic gates;Registers","","","","16","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking advantage of the EKV model formulation of the normalized $G_{m}/I_{D}$ and $\gamma_{n}$ in terms of the inversion coefficient $IC$, a simple expression of $F$ versus $IC$ for long and short channel transistors is derived. The proposed model of $F$ versus $IC$ for short-channel devices is validated against measurement from various CMOS technologies. Additional measurements of $G_{m}/I_{D}$ performed on FDSOI devices down to cryogenic temperatures show that it is a universal FoM almost independent of temperature. Since $F$ is proportional to $G_{m}/I_{D},\ F$ should also be almost temperature independent.

In this paper, we proposed a hardware efficient Softmax approximation which can be used as a direct plug-in substitution into pretrained transformer network to accelerate NLP tasks without compromising its accuracy.

Unfortunately, the iterative model-building process at the encoder comes with excessive computational demands. In this paper we introduce a novel edge-aware Autoencoder (AE) strategy designed to avoid the time-consuming iterative optimization of SMoE models. This is done by directly mapping pixel blocks to model parameters for compression, in spirit similar to recent works on “unfolding” of algorithms, while maintaining full compatibility to the established SMoE framework. With our plug-in AE encoder, we achieve a quantum-leap in performance with encoder run-time savings by a factor of 500 to 1000 with even improved image reconstruction quality.

In sensor networks, data is typically sensed and sent to an aggregator that will process it with local AI or send it to a cloud with larger AI. This centralized architecture has drawbacks such as the aggregator having to receive and process a potentially huge amount of data, which results in power consumption that can be significant. In addition, the transmission of all the sensor data results in extra consumption of energy due to communication. To reduce the impact of this last point, on-edge computing allows data to be pre-processed at the sensor level. It is often used in the architecture of distributed sensor networks in which each node receives data from other nodes in the network and processes it with its local data. In this work, a distributed sensor network model aims to solve this problem while reducing the impact of data transmission on energy consumption. The proposed model is able to reduce the number of transmitted bits per node by 90% in a node-to-node directed communication scenario. It is also capable of working with different AI paradigms depending on the required balance between energy consumption, application configurability, and accuracy.

In this work, we open the black box of the digital neuromorphic processor for algorithm designers by presenting the neuron processing instruction set and detailed energy consumption of the SENeCA neuromorphic architecture. For convenient benchmarking and optimization, we provide the energy cost of the essential neuromorphic components in SENeCA, including neuron models and learning rules.

Specifically, since the spatial and angular information of LFI are highly inter-twined with varying disparities, three targeted convolutions are designed to disentangle the spatial, angular and epipolar plane image (EPI) information in MacPI mode. Subsequently, the structural similarity (SSIM) maps are calculated between disentangled feature maps of the original and distorted LFIs. Furthermore, local binary patterns (LBP) operator and natural scene statistics (NSS) in two domains are used to extract the features on the SSIM maps as the quality-aware features of LFI. Finally, support vector regression (SVR) is used to simulate the nonlinear relationship between quality-aware feature and objective quality scores.

In view of this, we propose a multi-zone division-based inter prediction (MDIP) framework to improve the partitioning precision of moving objects and achieve the flexible description of the complex motion field. For each coding block, four multi-zone division modes are supported to adapt to the different motion situations in the block.

Using an example of a concurrent dual-band switch-mode push-pull power amplifier, this paper establishes that distributed baluns designed using traditional strategies, focusing solely on a balun's center frequency, lead to reduced efficiency due to the imperfect termination of the intermodulation components of their common mode signal. For solving this problem, a wide-band mixed-mode S-parameter analysis is employed to derive the common mode termination requirements of distributed baluns for concurrent dual-band operation; based on which, a generalized design procedure is developed to modify traditional balun designs. The modification provides the required termination to prevent common mode power loss while preserving the balun's performance in terms of input port matching, insertion loss, and amplitude and phase balance. The newly developed theory is tested by designing a modified concurrent dual-band tapped stepped-impedance balun.

We reduce runtime overhead by offloading part of self-attention computations offline before inference. Furthermore, we present a unified mapping method according to the computing characteristics of attention-based and convolution-based models.

This paper proposes an adaptive quantization method for activations and its hardware-friendly design to directly address the quantization overflow in inference. This method monitors the quantization overflow of activations on-the-fly, adaptively updates the quantization parameters, and re-quantizes the activations when the overflow degree is over a tunable threshold. We evaluate the proposed method on VGG16 and MobileNetV2 and experiment results show that 11% improvement in inference accuracy at severe quantization overflow is achieved with the cost of 3% increase in runtime, and tuning the threshold enables trade-off between inference accuracy and speed.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181695","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21B2031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181695","CNN;Quantization;Hardware Accelerator","Quantization (signal);Runtime;Costs;Uncertainty;Circuits and systems;Neural networks;Calibration","","2","","24","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many heuristic-based metrics for first-day mortality exist. However many signals exist in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) that are not used in these metrics. For the implementation of these metrics, it is important to keep the number of required signals as small as possible so that the user can quickly receive an assessment of their patient. In this paper, we leverage techniques from classical machine learning to compare sets of signals from a patients record (like demographic information, lab values, and vital sign measurements) to find the minimum feature set that best informs first day mortality. We compare several feature selection techniques to identify various feature sets with differing number of features. We found that Elastic Net was the overall best performing method and was able to reach the same performance as the current state of the art with less than half the features. This suggests that an optimal feature set is clinically meaningful.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182228","NSF(grant numbers:ECCS-1903466,OAC-2008690); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182228","Machine Learning;Healthcare;Human-centred design","Measurement;Circuits and systems;Current measurement;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Electronic medical records","","","","14","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For FeFET based AiMC designs, such effects can be controlled by using resistors or capacitors connected in series with FeFETs. However, in both cases, the effect of variability will again start dominating when the programming window shrinks further due to scaling towards smaller nanometer dimensions. Additionally, while resistance based solutions will add to the existing IR drop issues within the macro, capacitor based approach avoids such a case. In this paper, we evaluate a FeFET and capacitor based AiMC accelerator and study how finetuning cell operating parameters along with design modifications of the AiMC macro, can help in achieving a variability aware AiMC design. Using a 22-nm CMOS PDK augmented with FeFET model based on measured data, evaluation on a DNN with CIFAR-10 benchmark, demonstrated that following our approach, the implemented DNN achieves an accuracy of ∼85% which is an improvement of ∼13% over an untuned AiMC macro.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182103","Memory accelerator;in-memory computing;FeFET","Performance evaluation;Geometry;Semiconductor device modeling;Resistors;Resistance;System performance;Capacitors","","","","6","EU","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existing channel pruning methods use the approach of zeroing unnecessary filters and then removing them. To address the limitations of existing approaches, methods of creating forcibly filter redundancy and then removing redundant filters have been proposed without heuristic knowledge. However, these methods also use a deformed gradient to make filters identical, and performance degradation is inevitable because the parameters cannot be updated using the original gradients. To solve these problems, this study proposes RepSGD, which can compress CNNs simply and efficiently. RepSGD inserts a new point-wise convolution layer after the existing standard convolution layer. Subsequently, only new point-wise convolution layers are trained to produce filter redundancy (i.e., to make the filters identical), whereas the standard convolution layers are trained using the original gradient. After training, RepSGD merges two consecutive convolution layers into one convolution layer. Subsequently, the redundant filters in the merged convolution layer are pruned. Because RepSGD does not change the original architecture of the CNN, additional inference computation is not required, and it is possible to support training from scratch. In addition, using the original gradient in RepSGD optimizes the objective function of the CNNs better. We show that RepSGD outperforms existing pruning methods in various models and datasets through extensive experiments.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181631","MSIT(grant numbers:IITP-2023-RS-2022-00156295); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181631","CNN;Channel Pruning;Network Compression;Reparameterization","Training;Degradation;Convolution;Circuits and systems;Computational modeling;Redundancy;Computer architecture","","1","","34","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The exception is the single-bit Delta-Sigma Modulator (DSM), where the internal Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) is intrinsically linear and ideally no calibration is required, making it the architecture of choice in recent high linearity implementations [1]–[3].

Given the volatile feature of most ambient vibrations, energy management methods are necessary for matching the unstable energy supply from the MEH sources and the energy demand of timely IoT tasks. This paper summarizes and analyzes two energy buffer-release mechanisms (EBRM) from mechanical and electrical aspects, respectively, for ensuring the robust operation of motion-powered IoT systems. Rather than emphasizing harvesting more energy from vibrations, as most of the previous studies did, we focus on energy neutrality among the mechanical, electrical, and cyber ingredients.

However, images often come along with various text descriptions in real applications, while the influence of these text-guidances on the visual saliency of corresponding images have rarely been studied. Therefore, in this paper, we mainly focus on the problem of whether and how the text-guidance influences the visual attention during image viewing, and perform subjective experiments, qualitative and quantitative comparisons as well as model evaluations on this new task. Specifically, we first conduct eye tracking experiments on 300 images under text-visual (TV) and visual (V) test conditions, respectively. Based on the subjective experiments, we perform qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the visual attention data collected under TV and V conditions, and conclude that the text-guidance can significantly influence the visual attention, especially when the text-described target is a non-salient object. Finally, we evaluate the existing saliency models on our database, and find that existing models cannot well handle this text-induced saliency prediction task.

EACNN is an efficient CNN architecture that is based on co-optimization of algorithms and hardware. The proposed approach is based on linear approximation of the weights for pre-trained networks with low loss of accuracy. Furthermore, a weight substitution and remapping technique adopts linear approximation coefficients to replace CNN weights. That leads to a repetition of the weight values across different kernels and enables the reuse of CNN computations for various output feature maps. The input activations corresponding to the same linear co-efficient can be multiplied and accumulated first and then reused to generate multiple output feature maps. This computational reuse method reduces the number of multiplication and addition operations and memory accesses, which is efficiently supported by a dedicated element in the proposed EACNN. Experimental results on CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 datasets show that the proposed method eliminates around 61% of the multiplications in the network without significant loss of accuracy $(< 3\%)$.

However, the scalability issue is a known intractable problem that the current RDMA Network Interface Card (RNIC) cannot overcome as the number of connections increases to thousands. The key to the scalability bottleneck is managing the connection information cached on the RNIC. To solve the scalability problem, firstly, we test and analyze the behavior of the commercial RNIC when the network performance declines in the case of large-scale connections. Further, we give the performance model of RNIC and point out that the cache design is the key to scalability issues. Then, we propose a Scalable RDMA NIC (ScalaRNIC) architecture with a non-blocking and priority-programmable cache design. Besides, our cache design supports parametric configuration by the extended API. ScalaRNIC can maintain $\mathrm{a}\approx 100\%$ cache hit ratio for higher priority connections and keep message rates nearly equal to peak performance.

Even cutting-edge multi-channel audio-only speech enhancement (SE) algorithms used in modern hearing aids face significant hurdles since they typically magnify noises while failing to boost speech understanding in crowded social environments. Recently, for the first time we proposed a novel integration of 5G cloud-radio access network, internet of things (IoT), and strong privacy algorithms to develop 5G IoT enabled hearing aid (HA) [1]. In this demonstration, we show the first-ever transceiver (PHY layer) model for cloud-based audio-visual (AV) SE, which meets the requirements for high data rate and low latency of forthcoming multi-modal HAs (such as Google glasses with integrated HAs). Even in highly noisy conditions like cafés, clubs, conferences, meetings, etc., the transceiver [2] transmits raw AV information from a hearing aid system to a cloud-based platform and obtains a clear signal. In Fig. 1, we illustrate an example of our cloud-based AV SE hearing aid demonstration. Herein, the left-side computer and Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) x310 function as IoT systems (hearing aids), the right-side USRP serves as an access point or base station, and the right-side computer serves as a cloud-server for operating NN-based SE models. Please take note that the channel between the HA device and the cloud is defined as an uplink channel, whereas the channel between the access point (cloud) and the HA device is defined as a downlink channel. Given the time-varying sensitivity of the data received at HA devices, the uplink channel can therefore handle a variety of data rates. As a result, a customized long-term evolution (LTE)-based frame structure is developed for uplink transmission of data. It provides error-correction codes in the 1.4 MHz and 3 MHz bandwidths with a variety of modulations and code rates. Furthermore, the cloud access point simply supports a limited transmission rate because it only transmits audio data to the HA equipment. In order to support real-time AV SE, a modified frame structure for LTE with 1.4 MHz of bandwidth is developed. The AV SE algorithm receives cropped lip images of the target speaker and a noisy speech spectrogram, and it produces an ideal binary mask that lessens the noise-dominant regions while improving the speech-dominant areas. We use the depth-wise separable convolutions, reduced STFT window size of 32 ms, smaller STFT window shift of 8 ms, and 64 convolutions in the audio feature extraction layers of our Cochlea-Net [3] multi-modal AV SE neural network architecture to reduce processing latency. Furthermore, the visual feature extraction framework is employed. Our proposed architecture can handle streaming data frame-by-frame. Thus, the users will experience for the first time the real-world development of a physical layer transceiver that can perform AV SE in real-time under strict latency and data rate requirements. For this demonstration, we will bring two computers and two USRP x310 devices.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182060","","Convolutional codes;Cloud computing;Speech enhancement;Hearing aids;Feature extraction;Transceivers;Real-time systems","","","","3","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although multiple CGRA frameworks have been proposed, a complete heterogeneous CGRA exploration framework with tunable interconnect flexibility and fast design space exploration (DSE) is still lacking. In this paper, we propose an open-source template-based CGRA exploration framework that integrates the modeling of heterogeneous PEs and interconnects, RTL generation, DFG mapping, automatic simulation and verification, and fast DSE based on a CGRA framework TRAM. Moreover, we present a novel resource-efficient shared reconfigurable delay unit (RDU) for data synchronization, which can save the CGRA area by 7%, compared with the separated RDU. Further, the explored optimal heterogeneous architecture can reduce the area and power by 44.7% and 42.9% respectively, and improve the PE utilization by 20.4%, compared with the 8 × 8 baseline architecture in TRAM.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182204","CGRA framework;Heterogeneous CGRA;Design space exploration;Bayesian Optimization","Power demand;Circuits and systems;Integrated circuit interconnections;Energy efficiency;Space exploration;Reconfigurable architectures;Delays","","10","","30","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ongoing research, e.g., Repetitive Input Sharing (RIS), focuses on removing redundant matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) by exploiting computational reuse for higher energy efficiency. However, we argue that the RIS neglects the extra overheads of the computation reuse scheme. Moreover, analog CIM is inherently vulnerable to noise. Consequently, reusing the noisy MVM results may lead to severe accuracy degradation. To address the above issues, we first evaluate the extra buffer overheads resulting from the computation reuse scheme for storing repetitive MVM results in the buffer. Based on our evaluation, we find an optimal RIS reuse ratio that balances between buffer costs and the efficiency gain from computation reuse, leading to more energy reduction. In addition, we introduce the RIS-based Hybrid-CIM (H-RIS), which mixes up the analog CIM and digital near-memory-computing (NMC) at the pattern level to maintain accuracy. Based on the above techniques, when we set the RIS ratio to 25%, H-RIS increases 18% accuracy compared with the pure analog CIM and also reduces 97% energy compared with the pure digital NMC.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181793","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 111-2218-E-002-018-MBK); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181793","Computing-in-memory;activation compression;hybrid-CIM;deep neural networks (DNNs)","Degradation;Costs;System performance;Neural networks;Computer architecture;Market research;Energy efficiency","","","","18","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With emerging applications bring new features to NoCs with more complex and time-varying traffic, which turns the routing computation process into multi-objective optimization. However, We found that the existing routing algorithms cannot effectively achieve load-balanced between different traffic due to the static method of routing design. The routing algorithm design space will increase if all factors affecting routing are considered. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated promising opportunities applied to architecture design exploration. In this paper, we proposed a novel RL framework for adaptive routing design in NoCs. This method uses network information to select the best path to achieve load balance and lower communication latency at the same time. Unfortunately, with this method, the implementation overhead of RL increases rapidly as the network scale increases. Therefore, we introduce a linear function of approximate RL-based adaptive routing (LARE) to reduce implementation over-head. We conduct extensive experiments against state-of-the-art routing algorithms to evaluate our design. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of our design under synthetic traffic workloads and real applications.

Therefore, monitoring concepts that cover various sensor parameters such as gain, phase, noise figure or phase-noise became an active field of research. Another essential sensor parameter is the receiver's linearity. A major design challenge for on-chip linearity testing is the generation of a spectrally pure test signal. In the past, this was mainly tackled by sophisticated analog design of the test signal generator (TSG), such that the overall complexity of the test circuitry was increased. In this work, we propose a monitoring concept that eliminates the need for a pure test signal. This enables accurate on-chip linearity testing by the use of a low-cost TSG. With an imprecise test signal, accurate testing can be achieved by exploiting the test signal generator's repeatability. By means that, instead of injecting a spectrally pure test signal into the device under test (DUT), an imprecise test signal is injected multiple times, but each time scaled with a different, properly chosen factor. With this, all impairments affecting the test signal before the analog scaling can be separated from nonlinear effects after the scaling by digital signal processing. Thus, the requirements on the analog test circuitry are heavily relaxed. Ultimately, we proof our concept by simulation as well as measurement results.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181404","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181404","","Phase noise;Linearity;Signal generators;System-on-chip;Sensors;Safety;Radar applications","","","","18","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, to further reduce the area and power consumption, we remove the redundant transistors through transistor merging and logical expression reorganization. TSPC20, with only 20 transistors, is the most area-efficient FF compared to prior FFs that can operate in ULV regime. Post-layout simulations with 28nm process shows that TSPC20 achieves 48% (54%) power reduction at 0.3V/6Mhz (0.9V/1.4GHz) considering 10% data activity ratio, compared to the conventional transmission-gate flip-flop (TGFF).

We demonstrate stable persistent-firing attractor dynamics in a small on-chip network consisting of hWTA-connected neurons and excitatory recurrent synapses.

According to the measurement and stability performance analysis of the PUF challenge and response results from 16 chips, although most of the PUF cells were having stable states, a non-negligible number of cells remained in oscillating states, in addition to major inter-chips differences for stability performances. Dark bit masking and Temporal Majority Voting(TMV) is a common and effective method to stabilize a PUF source but it involves a trade-off between stability and entropy loss. Stabilization with a fixed process design cannot achieve the best performance considering the large stability variations across different chips. We proposed an adaptive PUF stabilization processing engine that provides an enhanced TMV approach with the ability to stabilize the PUF source without reducing the expected number of PUF entropy.

Most learned video codecs operate internally in the RGB domain for P-frame coding. B-frame coding for YUV 4:2:0 content is largely under-explored. In addition, while there have been prior works on variable-rate coding with conditional convolution, most of them fail to consider the content information. We build our scheme on conditional augmented normalized flows (CANF). It features conditional motion and inter-frame codecs for efficient B-frame coding. To cope with YUV 4:2:0 content, two conditional inter-frame codecs are used to process the Y and UV components separately, with the coding of the UV components conditioned additionally on the Y component. Moreover, we introduce adaptive feature modulation in every convolutional layer, taking into account both the content information and the coding levels of B-frames to achieve content-adaptive variable-rate coding.

The other scheme is based on acquiring the double-layer capacitance part of the inter-electrode impedance. This is in sharp contrast to the existing electrode impedance-aware charge balancing scheme which requires ADCs and computes the net charge in the digital domain. Hence the new impedance-aware charge-balancing scheme is more power friendly and can achieve charge balancing more quickly. The impedance-aware stimulator ASIC has been implemented using X-FAB's 180-nm CMOS process. The simulation results suggest that good charge balancing is achieved as the residual voltage on the electrode after the charge compensation reduces to 3.51 mV and 0.44 mV under the $R$ s-based and $C_{\text{dl}}$-based charge balancing schemes., respectively.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181919","NSFC(grant numbers:62150610498); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181919","Neurostimulator;Electrical safety;Charge balance;Inter-electrode impedance;Double-layer capacitance;Access resistance","Resistance;Electrodes;Impedance measurement;Circuits and systems;Simulation;Capacitance;CMOS process","","","","13","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a methodology for accounting for axonal delays in the training loop of deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), intending to efficiently solve machine learning tasks on data with rich temporal dependencies. We then conduct an empirical study of the effects of axonal delays on model performance during inference for the Adding task [1]–[3], a benchmark for sequential regression, and for the Spiking Heidelberg Digits dataset (SHD) [4], commonly used for evaluating event-driven models. Quantitative results on the SHD show that SNNs incorporating axonal delays instead of explicit recurrent synapses achieve state-of-the-art, over 90% test accuracy while needing less than half trainable synapses. Additionally, we estimate the required memory in terms of total parameters and energy consumption of accomodating such delay-trained models on a modern neuromorphic accelerator [5], [6]. These estimations are based on the number of synaptic operations and the reference GF-22nm FDX CMOS technology. As a result, we demonstrate that a reduced parameterization, which incorporates axonal delays, leads to approximately 90% energy and memory reduction in digital hardware implementations for a similar performance in the aforementioned task.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181778","EU(grant numbers:824164,871371,871501,89955); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181778","Spiking Neural Networks;Synaptic Delays;Axonal Delays;Temporal Signal Analysis;Spiking Heidelberg Digits","Training;Semiconductor device modeling;Systematics;Neuromorphics;Memory management;Benchmark testing;Delays","","6","","35","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we proposed a system that uses long-term recurrent convolutional networks (LRCN) using non-invasive biomedical signal recording to estimate the blood glucose level. The proposed LRCN is combined with a robust feature extraction mechanism and can benefit from the temporal sensitivity of long short-term memory, to find a mathematical relationship between a photoplethysmogram (PPG) and blood glucose levels. The proposed system achieved 4.7 and 11.146 as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), respectively, on the predicted BGL values in comparison with standard BGL invasive blood sample recordings device values.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182141","","Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Glucose;Recording;Diabetes;Biosensors;Convolutional neural networks","","4","","11","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For long- and short-range temporal information exploration, we adopt temporal prior and progressive guided motion compensation. Specifically, with the continuously updating strategy, the temporal prior can provide rich mutual information between the overall prior and the current frame, facilitating Gaussian parameter prediction in the entropy model. Besides, the progressive guided motion compensation utilizes flow-to-kernel and scale-by-scale stable guiding strategy, thus achieving robust and effective inter coding. Furthermore, existing low-latency-oriented methods often suffer from strong error propagation, so we extend the framework with a bidirectional prediction scheme and propose the bidirectional temporal prior.

Hence, more feature information is preserved and a smaller size network is required for the classification task. Comprehensive simulations using MIT-BIH ECG datasets show that this model can perform ECG feature classification with shorter time window, faster training convergence while achieving comparable training and classification accuracy with much lower weigh resolution.

With the rise of under-screen optical sensing, PD is no longer sufficient for low-light level light detection and real-time low light level flicker detection. While an emerging detector, single photon avalanche diode (SPAD), shows its advantage to ultralow light sensing. However, SPAD tends to saturate at high light levels, which limits its widespread application. To inspire ambient light sensor design and address these issues, this paper proposes a high sample per second (SPS), wide dynamic range (DR) and ultralow illuminance detection SPAD array system on chip (SoC). A $16\times 16$ SPAD array architecture along with counter and charge-pump is designed in 180nm BCD process to sense 100μdux ambient light at 660nm. On-chip FFT processor of 2048 points with 32-bit accuracy is realized to process sampled optical waveform for flicker detection. Besides, an area-efficient integrated charge pump is implemented to regulate high-voltage (19~25V) to SPADs with on-chip digital auto-gain control (AGC), which improves the optical DR from 87db to 123db.

The front-end uses auto-zeroing to cancel differential and common-mode DC offsets originating from neural electrodes. Since many neural stimulation paradigms have a low-duty cycle but very large amplitudes, we introduce a coordinated timing (CO-T) scheme that dynamically resets the front-end during narrow stimulation pulses.

The over-sampling PLL increases sam-pling frequency by 4x, reducing the in-band phase noise and overcoming the loop bandwidth limitation due to the reference frequency. Leveraging the increased loop bandwidth, the noise contribution of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is sig-nificantly suppressed. The high-gain CSPD adopts a common-mode sampling technique with time interleaving switches to ensure that the reference clock is sampled only at the maximum slew rate. The CSPD with a higher gain facilitates reducing the noise contribution from the phase detector (PD) and the transconductance cell.

Therefore, tooth-marked tongue classification is important to health diagnosis in TCM clinic. Existing classification methods usually do not use the prior knowledge such as the location and width of tooth-marks, resulting in easily misclassification of unremarkable tongues. In this paper, we propose a prior regularization tooth-marked tongue method (PRTMTM), which makes full use of the prior knowledge of the position and width of tooth-marks. With PRTMTM, the original tongue image is first segmented to obtain the tongue edge position. Then, the prior mask map of tooth-marks is obtained by corroding the tongue from edge to interior according to the tooth-mark width. Finally, with a proposed regularization method, the tooth-marked tongues are classified accurately in the training process together with the prior mask map of tooth-marks. To verify our method comprehensively, we build twenty-five sub-training sets with different number of images and label distributions. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the accuracy of our method is improved by 4.78% on average and 10.61% on maximum, the AUC by 0.04 on average and 0.07 on maximum, and the generated heatmap can highlight tooth-marked regions.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181870","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:92164110,U19B2041); Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology(grant numbers:042003266); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181870","traditional Chinese medicine;tooth-marked tongue classification;convolutional neural network;priori regularization","Training;Heating systems;Stomach;Image segmentation;Tongue;Circuits and systems;Image edge detection","","","","21","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The impressive success of deep convolutional neural networks extracting information from raw data in computer vision and natural language processing has motivated their investigation into EEG signal decoding. Consequently, a number of deep convolutional neural network models with state-of-the-art performance have been proposed in the literature for EEG signal decoding. However, because all these works aimed to find the model architecture with the best decoding accuracy, the model's size was left unbounded in that exploration. Considering the model size in the design of deep convolutional neural networks for EEG decoding could make their implementation on low-power microcontrollers (that may be integrated into a wearable system) with limited memory feasible. Thus, in this paper, we search for the most accurate deep convolutional neural network on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset that can also fit in a microcontroller with less than 256KB SRAM. Specifically, we use a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that considers, apart from the model's accuracy, the model size, the latency, and the peak memory utilization when running the model's inference. We compare our models with the model with the best decoding accuracy in the literature on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset (baseline).

On the other hand, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) can measure the uncertainty of their predictions. There are two methods for BNN inference, the Monte Carlo-based method, which requires the sampling of weights distributions and multiple inference iterations, and moment propagation, where the mean and variance of a normal distribution are propagated through the BNN. Hardware implementations of moment propagation BNN inference consume less power than Monte Carlo because they complete the inference in a single forward pass. However, because the propagation of distribution moments through nonlinear activation functions leads to large hardware designs, these functions are usually approximated by polynomials. Hardware implementations of moment propagation have been studied solely for fully-connected neural networks while lacking optimal accuracy due to the approximation of the ReLU activation function with a single polynomial term. Therefore, in this work, we add one more polynomial term in the approximation of ReLU, providing better accuracy with negligible additional hardware. We also propose a polynomial approximation for another common activation function, tanh, and extend the hardware implementation to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approximation of ReLU outperforms the previously suggested single-term polynomial by achieving up to 5.9% higher accuracy with merely up to 0.029 $W$ power overhead.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181925","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181925","Bayesian Neural Network;FPGA;Moment Propagation;ReLU polynomial approximation;tanh polynomial approximation","Uncertainty;Monte Carlo methods;Image recognition;Measurement uncertainty;Gaussian distribution;Hardware;Bayes methods","","","","14","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed forward predicting ANN depicts that considering the complete structural and material information of the cylindrical nano-pillar meta-atoms could predict the corresponding electromagnetic (EM) response (amplitude and phase of transmission) with a mean squared error (MSE) as low as $\mathbf{2.1}\times \mathbf{10}^{-\mathbf{3}}$. Thus, it replaces the conventional EM simulations performed using high-end commercial software's, while significantly saving time and computational resources. Inverse design deep-learning model is also presented, which is connected with the pre-trained forward model and trained in a tandem architecture to provide an optimum set of dimensions and material, given the target response as its input. Furthermore, a comparative study regarding the number of hidden layers of the ANN and the amount of training dataset size is performed for the proposed forward and tandem inverse models to analyze the effect of considering extra underlying physics related information, i.e., wavelength regime and the EM spectral information. This study reveals that considering the extra information can lead to a significant reduction in the obtained MSE. Specifically, the proposed model could achieve a decent MSE even with a smaller amount of training dataset. Hence, the use of artificial intelligence models significantly reduces the training time and computational complexity of the proposed solution.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181524","artificial intelligence;nano-structures;tandem inverse design","Training;Inverse problems;Computational modeling;Artificial neural networks;Computer architecture;Software;Electromagnetics","","4","","15","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To mitigate the metastability during the clock-domain crossing, a technique titled metastability inference and avoidance (MIAA) is presented. MIAA infers the potential metastability risk of a synchronizer's sampling clock through phase detection of a phase-related clock. MIAA avoids the occurrence of metastability by adaptively modulating the clock phase of the sampling clock once it infers the potential metastability risk. We designed a MIAA-based 40nm GALS $2\times 2$ NoC that contains four independent voltage/frequency domains. The post-layout simulation results show that MIAA can well predict the metastability risks and reduce the probability of metastability to zero across a wide range of frequency ratios. The metastability mitigation allows us to use a single flip-flop instead of a multi-stage synchronizer for synchronization in the NoC, thereby improving the latency and throughput of the NoC by 40.2% and 79%, respectively.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181952","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181952","metastability;near-threshold voltage;network-on-chip (NoC)","Electric potential;Simulation;Network-on-chip;Voltage;Throughput;Synchronization;Data communication","","1","","19","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Next, DFA is used to threshold the predominantly noisy modes based on their scaling exponent and higher frequency content. Finally, using a shrinkage method on predominantly noisy modes, the denoised signal is reconstructed by the combination of the denoised modes and the remaining IMFs which were obtained as an output from the first step. A comprehensive simulation-based study demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods in signal denoising.

Since repetitive textures typically exist in the screen content video, the non-local information used in IBC can improve coding performance significantly. However, the local information thoroughly investigated in intra prediction has not been explored in IBC. In this paper, local-aware intra block copy (LA-IBC) is proposed to further improve the coding performance of IBC. LA-IBC is composed of three methods. First, combined IBC and intra prediction (IBC-CIIP) is proposed to fuse the two prediction signals generated by IBC and intra prediction. Second, IBC with geometry partitioning (IBC-GPM) is proposed, in which a block is divided into two sub-partitions geometrically and IBC and intra prediction are used to obtain their prediction signals, individually. Third, IBC with local illumination compensation (IBC-LIC) is proposed to explore the illumination variation between the local and non-local templates within the picture. LA-IBC is integrated in the latest exploration software of video coding (Enhanced Compression Model, ECM) published by JVET to evaluate its efficiency.

This paper proposes a novel technique based on input vector analysis and transistor stacking to analyze and suppress leakage, especially for extremely high threshold voltage (EHVT) circuits operating in the near/sub-threshold regime. At the device level, we consider the leakage ratio of each transistor terminal, which improves the universality of the method. At the circuit level, we innovatively propose the concepts of critical leakage path, leakage power components, and public leakage path to help designers locate the sources of leakage more precisely. We apply the method to a 28nm-EHVT low leakage tristate latch-like memory cell in a serial Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) circuit and find that inserting one stacking NMOS and using “01” stack to reduce the substrate leakage of PMOS can effectively suppress leakage. The average leakage power consumption of the optimized cell is reduced by 42% in the pre-layout simulation. A 26.87% and 17.52% leakage power reduction in the custom cell and the serial FFT circuit is achieved after the layout design and the synthesis.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182138","leakage suppression;static power consumption;design methodology;stack effect;near/sub-threshold","Semiconductor device modeling;Power demand;Stacking;Memory management;Layout;CMOS technology;Threshold voltage","","3","","16","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a hardware security primitive, the intrinsic physical unclonable function (PUF) is a possible countermeasure for these attacks with low resource overheads. In this work, a novel intrinsic PUF, frequency adjustable software PUF (FAS-PUF), is proposed to provide a device identification for PQC chips. The FAS-PUF is based on an inherent timing logic in the ring-learning with error (R-LWE) decryption circuit of PQC chips. The FAS-PUF uses a $256^{\ast}13^{\ast} 3$-bit input ciphertext of the decryption circuit as a challenge, and uses a 256-bit decryption output as a response with an adjustable overclocking. Since the entropy of the FAS-PUF utilises the manifested timing errors caused by the overclocking, the FAS-PUF does not need to modify the existing hardware circuits, i.e. preserves the original circuit functions, which significantly reduces hardware resource consumption and power overhead. Meanwhile, to mitigate the affection of circuits' metastablities to PUF's stability under overclocking, a dynamic clock frequency selection method is used to determine the optimal frequency point for generating PUF responses. The proposed FAS-PUF is also a Strong PUF design with a significant number of Challenge/Response Pairs (CRPs) provided. The proposed design is implemented on Xilinx Basys3 FPGAs.

It needs $N\times N$ memory cells ($N\times N$ is the resolution on the sensor). Some works reduce memory complexity by sacrificing the performance of the filter. To ensure the filtering effect and reduce the filter's memory complexity, this paper proposes a novel filter: Queue-based spatiotemporal filter. Moreover, based on the Queue-based spatiotemporal filter, this paper proposes a clustering algorithm that can cluster while filtering. Experiments show that the proposed filter's performance is similar to the $O(N^{2})$-Space spatiotemporal filter while having a lower memory complexity. Besides, using the proposed clustering algorithm, the objects in motion can be clustered with low calculation complexity.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181868","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62074041); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181868","DVS;Spatiotemporal Filter;Background Activity;Clustering;Hardware Friendly","Filtering;Heuristic algorithms;Dynamics;Clustering algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Vision sensors;Robustness","","1","","11","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has attracted researchers' attention as a novel storage medium to address these issues with its high storage density, low maintenance cost, and extremely long shelf life. Specifically, DNA is also environmentally friendly compared to traditional disk storage because the disk is non-degradable. In this paper, we propose a strategy for image coding and storage based on compressing intra-predicted images from Versatile Video Coding (VVC) using synthetic genomics theories that enable the high throughput storage of images on DNA. We first define the length and format of the DNA oligo for the implementation of a storage system. Then we improve the LT codes to become a feasible DNA coding scheme. Last but not least, we design a voting mechanism to achieve the error correction function for robustness. The experimental results show high compression efficiency while achieving several strict biological constraints, such as GC-content balance and homopolymer control.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182162","Image coding;visual communications;Versatile Video Codec;GC-content balance;homopolymer control;syn-thetic genomics;high throughput DNA storage","Video coding;Image coding;Codes;Redundancy;DNA;Genomics;Throughput","","2","","23","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, two major barriers hinder the widespread application of this research paradigm. First, subjects often need to be wire-connected to rack-mount instrumentation for data acquisition, which negatively affects sleep quality. Second, conventional real-time sleep stage classification algorithms give limited performance. In this work, we conquer these two limitations by developing a sleep modulation system that supports closed-loop operations on the device. Sleep stage classification is performed using a lightweight deep learning (DL) model accelerated by a low-power field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device. The DL model uses a single channel electroencephalogram (EEG) as input. Two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to capture general and detailed features, and a bidirectional long-short-term memory (LSTM) network is used to capture time-variant sequence features. An 8-bit quantization is used to reduce the computational cost without compromising performance. The DL model has been validated using a public sleep database containing 81 subjects, achieving a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 85.8% and a F1-score of 79%.

Prior work can approximate the non-linear operations with piecewise linear (PWL) function, but such approximation neglects considering the hardware overhead simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel approximation framework called Auto-LUT, which leverages a neural network to automatically approximate the non-linear operations. The framework formulates the approximation error and hardware overhead as a multi-objective optimization problem and employs an automated search mechanism to find the minimum number of segments and data bit width. To improve the approximation accuracy, we propose a bias clipping operation during the training of approximation networks, which enforces the model to approximate within the range of interest. Moreover, a hardware-friendly quantization scheme is further introduced to simulate the hardware behavior, thereby reducing the hardware overhead. Finally, a customized hardware architecture based on FPGA is utilized to deploy the quantized result. The experimental results show that Auto-LUT costs 56.32% less LUTs and 32.31% less flip-flops (FF) while reducing 4.32% approximation error compared to the state-of-the-art method.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181655","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFA1003602); Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20200038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181655","Neural Networks;Non-linear Approximation;Quantization;FPGA","Training;Quantization (signal);Costs;Neural networks;Approximation error;Search problems;Hardware","","4","","26","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Timely diagnosis and detection of vascular dementia is critical to avoid brain damage.

Currently, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Computerized Tomography (CT) scan and carotid ultrasound are mainly used for brain imaging and vascular dementia diagnosis. However, these technologies are expensive, require extensive medical supervision and are not easily accessible. This can cause substantial delay in diagnosis and potentially lead to irreversible damage.

It is designed to operate as part of a portable device and can effectively diagnose underlying causes like brain infarction, stroke and blood clots at the initial stage. The developed sensor designs are validated using microwave computational software and fabricated models are experimentally verified using artificial stroke and blood clot targets inside an artificial brain model.

It is rare to see figures for power consumption, partly due to the difficulty of obtaining accurate power readings. In this paper, we introduce a composite score that aims to characterize the trade-off between accuracy and power consumption measured during the inference of neural networks. For this purpose, we present a new open-source tool allowing researchers to consider more metrics: granular power consumption, but also RAM/CPU/GPU utilization, as well as storage, and network input/output (I/O). To our best knowledge, it is the first fit test for neural architectures on hardware architectures. This is made possible thanks to reproducible power efficiency measurements. We applied this procedure to state-of-the-art neural network architectures on miscellaneous hardware. One of the main applications and novelties is the measurement of algorithmic power efficiency. The objective is to allow researchers to grasp their algorithms' efficiencies better. This methodology was developed to explore trade-offs between energy usage and accuracy in neural networks.

Hence, these sensors are not suitable for long-term measurements. This paper presents a novel, wireless, behind-the-ear wearable EEG acquisition device that incorporates flexible dry EEG sensors. Silver ink-printed flexible sensors are fabricated using screen printing to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks and limitations of conventional EEG sensors. The flexible sensors form a capacitive link with the skin via an adhesive layer between the sensor and the person's skin and are capable of acquiring the EEG without any skin preparation or gel. The performance of the printed flexible EEG sensors is tested by comparing them with the standard Ag/AgCl pre-gelled sensors. The alpha wave test and evoked potential EEG test are also performed for verification.

Model-based state estimation methodology provides highly robust and accurate battery state estimation. However, separate estimation of states, such as State-of-Charge (SOC), State-of-Health (SOH), and State-of-Power (SOP), leads to erroneous estimation since the states are highly interdependent. A co-estimation methodology for SOC, SOH, and SOP using a highly accurate and stable formulation of the Kalman filter, i.e., the Dual Square Root Unscented Kalman filter (D-SRUKF) is proposed in this paper. The proposed battery states co-estimation methodology has been validated using experimental battery test data. The results show that SOC estimation error is 0.404 %, with an improvement of 77.60% compared to separate state estimation using the D-SRUKF estimator and 58.02% compared to state-of-the-art EKF-RLS co-estimation methodology. SOH and SOP are also co-estimated within the same filter, leading to accurate estimation without adding to the computational complexity of the system. The accuracy of SOH estimation is improved by 16.98% compared to the EKF-RLS co-estimation.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181678","Defence Research and Development Organisation; Ministry of Defence, Govt. of India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181678","State-of-Charge (SOC);State-of-Health (SOH);State-of-Power (SOP);Co-estimation;Dual Square Root Unscented Kalman Filter (D-SRUKF);EKF(Extended Kalman Filter);RLS(Recursive Least Square)","Space vehicles;Estimation;Threshold voltage;Real-time systems;Batteries;Smart grids;State of charge","","2","","25","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep convolutional neural networks provide an excellent framework for obtaining highly representative feature vectors from images to improve an image retrieval method. Deep residual networks perform better than existing deep networks, as they can incorporate useful information into the feature vectors through residual learning by designing appropriate operations in the employed residual block. One type of such information is spatial information obtained at different scales and levels of abstraction. In this paper, a novel residual block is proposed to generate a rich set of features for the task of image retrieval. The development of the residual block consists of three modules: a hierarchical spatial feature extraction module focusing on spatial information at different abstraction levels, a multi-scale feature extraction module that generates features at three different scales, and a feature fusion module. The results of experiments on various datasets and an ablation study show that the proposed residual block noticeably improves the representational capacity of the network, which, in turn, significantly enhances the retrieval performance of the deep image retrieval network.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181673","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181673","image retrieval;deep learning;spatial information;residual blocks","Fuses;Databases;Circuits and systems;Image retrieval;Focusing;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks","","","","25","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The deterioration of brain-related tasks and cognitive abilities is one of the major challenges being faced by the ageing population today. It is noted that electrical signals that are transmitted by neurons in the brain, are a good way to indicate the health and performance of the brain for an individual. However, current systems, such as EEGs and f-MRIs are bulky, time-consuming, and overall uncomfortable or inconvenient for older people to use. In this paper, a wearable RF device is presented that utilises integrated textile-based RF sensors and a flexible switching circuit to monitor the electrical activity in the brain. The device was validated with a brain phantom model that was fabricated with materials that mimicked the dielectric properties of an actual brain. In addition, a function generator was used in order to generate voltage signals at 4 Hz, 12 Hz, and 35 Hz in the phantom, which emulates the presence of electrical activity in the brain. Results showed the reflected signals captured by the sensors were able to differentiate between the voltage signals that were generated at different frequency levels.

Most of these repairing methods create a small monopole antenna as a byproduct which affects its electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Switching activity in the transmitted signal through the wire creates an unintentional emission, called emanation, according to Maxwell's equations. This emanation is usually weak and suppressed to conform to EMC requirements. However, the monopole antenna of the repaired cable helps transmit it better, increasing the SNR of the emanation and extending its detection range significantly. This creates a serious security issue as emanations contain a significant correlation with the source signal and can be exploited for information extraction. In this work, the electromagnetic aspects of the broken cable repairing process have been explored in detail. We have applied the most commonly used cable repairing methods (twisting, soldering, and butt connector) to 3 types of widely used cables (USB, power, and HDMI cable) which are broken intentionally for experimental purposes. Collected data shows that the emanation SNR increases significantly due to the repairing process with −47 dBm power at a 20 cm distance. Although emanation power varies from cable to cable, it remains detectable even at >4 m distances. This strong emanation can penetrate through obstacles and remain detectable up to ~1 $\mathbf{m}$ distance through a 14 cm thick concrete wall. Along with exploring the vulnerability, a possible remedy, external metal shielding, has been explored in detail. This work exposes a new dimension of information leakage.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181751","Office of the Director of National Intelligence; Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity(grant numbers:2021-21062400006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181751","emanation;broken cable;cyber-physical sys-tems;vulnerability;eavesdropping;information leakage","Power cables;Metals;Maintenance engineering;Electromagnetic compatibility;Universal Serial Bus;Security;Electromagnetics","","4","","20","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-tenancy is an emerging phenomenon in cloud FPGAs to enable resource efficiency. In a multi-tenant scenario, multiple users can share the same FPGA fabric either spatially (i.e., tenants share different resources at the same time) or temporally (tenants share the same resources in different time slots). Undesired access or manipulation of other tenant's data can cause security and safety issues. Although safety/security concepts in access control policies have been thoroughly studied in conventional cloud systems, they are relatively unknown for cloud FPGAs. Moreover, these concepts may not trivially extend to cloud FPGAs due to their different nature. This paper proposes an improved access control mechanism for multi-tenant cloud FPGAs. Compared to existing commercial tools, our solution allows dynamic configuration of access control privileges. Compared to earlier academic proposals with dynamic configuration, the results show that our proposal has three advantages: (i) enabling secure resource sharing of on-chip BRAMs to tenants, (ii) enabling safe sharing by resolving deadlocks and faulty access requests, and (iii) improvement in latency and throughput.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181609","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N00014-21-1-2809,N00014-21-1-2811); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181609","Multi-tenant cloud FPGAs;access control mechanism;memory isolation","Access control;Cloud computing;System recovery;Throughput;System-on-chip;Safety;Proposals","","","","15","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel spiking neural network (SNN) architecture is proposed for solving regression tasks, and a multi-objective gradient descent (MOGD) algorithm is employed to generate high-quality wind power prediction intervals (PIs). SNNs improve upon conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) by encoding interneuron communication into temporally-distributed spikes, which reduce memory access frequency and data communication, and therefore, the computational power requirements of deep learning workloads. This becomes exceedingly important for continual data analysis in remote geographic regions which often lack reliable cloud access and power supply, where many wind power farms are stationed. Given that neuron spikes are all stereotypically treated to be identical, they are a natural fit for tasks that may conflict in a common network architecture, such as multimodal data or where multiple, potentially competing, objectives are being optimized for. This paper proposes an SNN architecture that achieves comparable performance with its ANN counterpart on a complex regression task, i.e., wind power interval prediction. The resulting multi-objective SNN demonstrates superior performance as compared with those from state-of-art ANNs in wind power interval prediction.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181537","Spiking neural network;wind power forecasting;multi-objective optimization","Uncertainty;Systems operation;Artificial neural networks;Wind power generation;Predictive models;Numerical models;Smart grids","","1","","27","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data produced in these applications is highly sensitive and requires a high level of security protection. However, individual nodes in WSNs are typically resource constrained and have limited computing power to protect memory stored secrets, which are vulnerable to tampering and physical probing. As group messaging is commonly used in WSNs for efficient message exchanges among sensor nodes, this paper presents a lightweight secure group key agreement protocol using Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) as a hardware root of trust. The proposed scheme establishes secure group authentication and group session key simultaneously for all participating members of the group without resorting to complex public-key algorithms. By hiding the prover's authentication secrets in a secure mask, the verifier does not have to store the secrets but recover them for authentication by querying its PUF. The proposed protocol enables lightweight cluster head authentication at the sensor node and prevents stolen-verifier attack at the cluster head. Besides, it is robust against memory probing attacks at all group devices and man-in-the-middle attacks on the communication channel. Among existing PUF-based group key establishment protocols, it requires zero secret storage cost and exhibits excellent overall computation and communication performance.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181666","Ministry of Education, Singapore(grant numbers:MOET2EP50220-0003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181666","","Performance evaluation;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Military computing;Authentication;Transportation;Public key","","2","","12","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed topology consists of a 3-phase 4:1 switched-capacitor stage, reducing the switching node swing to 12-V (1/4 of the input) to significantly reduce switching loss, and an inductor to softly charge and discharge the flying capacitors with an extra phase (hence 4-phase operation) with controlled duty cycle to regulate the output voltage to 1V for direct-down conversion. The converter operates with a 4X effective switching frequency, which reduces the ripple/inductance required or switching frequency for better efficiency. With the same output voltage ripples as double step-down (DSD) and 3-level (3L1P) buck converters, the on-time is 4X that of DSD and 3L1P converters, which reduces the challenges in controller design. Lower-voltage (LV) transistors, such as 12-V devices, can be used in some of the switches to significantly improve efficiency. When compared to DSD and 3-Level converters that are state-of-the-art integrated topologies, with the same inductor, output capacitor, and output ripples in the same BCD process, this design achieves: 1) an efficiency comparable or higher than DSD (e.g., ∼3% higher at 48V-1V/5A); 2) along with using only one inductor instead of two for DSD, which can reduce the cost and increase the power density; and 3) much higher efficiency compared to a 3-level buck converter.

Generally, the two most common stimulation methods are passive recharge – a monophasic pulse followed by a shorting phase that clears accumulated charge – and biphasic stimulation. Passive recharge is safe and power-efficient; however, it has a long recovery time after every pulse that is dictated by the time constant of the neural electrode. Biphasic stimulation rapidly recovers the electrode-tissue interface; however, its main drawback is that it is reliant on precisely matched current sources and electrode linearity to ensure chronic safety. We present a novel stimulation method and system, Active Pulse-Clamp Stimulation (APCS), that achieves guaranteed charge-balance with rapid recovery. Rather than relying on precisely matched current sources or slow, complex compensation techniques, APCS uses discrete-time feedback to ensure that the electrode interface settles rapidly after every pulse. During the recovery period, a clock toggles the state between monitoring and discharging the voltage of the electrode's double-layer capacitance. Unlike passive recharge, the recovery time is fully-customizable. And unlike biphasic stimulation, the interface will always recover to the specified voltage for guaranteed safety. To demonstrate an APCS proof-of-concept, we implemented the stimulator in a 180nm HV CMOS process. We demonstrated both rapid, customizable recovery time and charge balancing using a benchtop electrode model and a clinical electrode in saline.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181786","APCS;neural stimulation;charge balancing","Electrodes;Semiconductor device modeling;Resistance;Circuits and systems;Linearity;Feedback amplifiers;Safety","","3","","13","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Spatial information is crucial in obtaining highly representative feature vectors for image retrieval, and deep convolutional neural networks provide an excellent framework to generate such features. Through convolutional operations, deep convolutional neural networks include spatial information in the feature maps. However, most available architectures cannot include adequate spatial details in the feature maps required for high-performance image retrieval. Deep residual networks are deep networks capable of including useful information through residual learning. This paper proposes a novel residual block to generate feature maps by focusing on spatial information. The proposed residual block comprises three modules: a spatial feature extraction module, a hierarchical feature extraction module, and a feature fusion module. The first module includes spatial information in the feature maps at different levels of abstraction, while the second module includes spatial information using conventional convolution hierarchy. The third model fuses the outputs of the first two modules to provide a very rich set of feature maps. The present study tests a deep network employing the proposed residual block. The results indicate that the proposed network performs comparably or is superior to state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks, thus showing the effectiveness of the proposed residual block in improving the representational capacity.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182225","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182225","image retrieval;residual learning;spatial information","Fuses;Convolution;Circuits and systems;Image retrieval;Focusing;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks","","2","","26","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve acoustic space separation, virtual sensing is required to estimate the time-varying primary path from the noise source to the ZoQ without a preliminary identification stage and to track time fluctuations. Therefore, in this paper, an acoustic path model is proposed, that can be used to observe the ZoQ from a physical error microphone, and the structure of virtual sensing is designed to cope with environments in which many reflected waves are present.

As LiDAR's point clouds become more massive, it is a great challenge to implement a fast and energy-efficient KNN implementation.

To solve this issue, we propose a high-locality data structure RPS (range-projection-structure) and an ultra-fast FPGA accelerator of the building and searching process. First, we propose a novel data structure RPS which ensures the points with similar projection locations and range scales are stored in the continuous locations of a memory. Second, we propose a highly-parallel method to build the RPS by projecting the points into a point cloud matrix and parallelly processing the points in a column. Third, based on RPS, we propose a highly-parallel KNN search algorithm, which can quickly narrow the search region and select the KNN from neighboring points in parallel. Experimental results show that our method achieves 13.7 times faster than other FPGA implementations.

A globally asynchronous locally synchronous system (GALS) is an alternative approach to ensure chip operation while maintaining performance. This paper presents an energy-efficient asynchronous interface with a delay-insensitive protocol for the GALS system. As the prior delay-insensitive interface consumes significant energy, low-swing signaling by stacking the voltage domain reduces energy consumption at little cost. In addition, adaptive timing control is implemented to support a long wire connection and improve interface robustness. As a result, the energy-efficient asynchronous interface implemented on 65nm technology consumed 1.6x less energy than the prior delay-insensitive asynchronous interface while being able to drive wire up to 1.25mm long.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182011","Globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) system;asynchronous interface;delay-insensitive asynchronous circuit","Performance evaluation;Energy consumption;Protocols;Temperature;Wires;Stacking;Energy efficiency","","","","14","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) alleviates the clipping distortion by folding out-of-range signals into a within-range via modulo operations. The USF signal recovery assumes an infinitesimal residual step time in the modulo operation which is generally practically infeasible. Its recovery error is inevitable due to the remainder sampling error during the residual step transition time. Instead of the infinitesimal assumption, a residual-remainder coupled USF is proposed to eliminate the remainder sampling error by coupling the residual sampling component. It is shown that the proposed coupling framework does not only relax the oversampling rate in the original USF to approaching the Nyquist sampling rate, but also provides a more accurate signal recovery capability as the remainder sampling error is eliminated by the coupling of the residual components.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181587","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021TFB2401900); NRC(grant numbers:NRF2018NCR-NCR002-001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181587","Analog to Digital Conversion;high-dynamic-range sampling;Modulo Operation","Couplings;Uncertainty;Fluctuations;Circuits and systems;Signal sampling;Coupling circuits;Distortion","","1","","18","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Third, an improved 3D convolutional neural network is proposed to extract depth features from the fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) images. Finally, the multi-scale features are linearly fused and select with LASSO algorithm. The support vector machine is utilized for five-fold cross-validation.

Recent principal component analysis (PCA)-based methods provide an effective alternative to align point clouds and produce the RI representation under the preservation of global information. However, conventional PCA with 3-D coordinates cannot fully represent high-dimensional geometric structures like surfaces and curves and cannot uniformly align these structures for learning RI representation. In this paper, we propose a novel rotation-invariant method for point cloud segmentation, which leverages kernel PCA (KPCA) for aligning point clouds in a projected high-dimensional space via non-linear mapping and develops a Geometry-based Weighted Convolution (GWConv) to distinguish part boundaries during segmentation. Specifically, the KPCA produces a RI representation with polynomial kernels for effectively representing complicated geometric structures in point clouds.

Bespoke primer design is tested and optimised with synthetic DNA to achieve high specificity and low sensitivity (100 copies). The primer efficiencies were also tested on our in-house LoC system showing near identical results to those obtained from a qPCR instrument.

Although there have been extensive works experimentally characterizing and analyzing CMOS transistors at ∼4 K, there is a lack of digital and memory subsystem study. Since on-chip SRAM is one of the most power-consuming and the most vulnerable element in cryogenic SoC, this work analyzes the stability of low-voltage 6T-SRAM at deep cryogenic temperature (i.e 77K and 8K), in comparison with 300K operation.

Regarding the Read static noise margin, our simulation showed that the inverters exhibit pseudo-static hysteresis and interestingly this leads to an improvement of read static noise margin of the cell, similar to what observed in a Schmitt-Trigger SRAM. These results suggest that although CMOS transistors exhibit higher threshold voltage in cryogenic temperature, it is still possible to operate the SRAM at low-voltage for power saving in quantum computing applications.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181946","A*STAR(grant numbers:C210917009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181946","Cryo-CMOS;SRAM Analysis","Semiconductor device modeling;Low voltage;Quantum computing;Cryogenics;SRAM cells;Stability analysis;Threshold voltage","","2","","21","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the NAND2 and NOR2 gates are evaluated at nominal conditions and considering the process variability impact on the radiation sensitivity. After that, three different topologies of the same circuit are analyzed, showing that even when considering process variability, the circuit's robustness is highly dependent on its output gates and that the most sensitive part of a circuit may vary given process variability.

In this work, we propose a circuit-level solution to handle security challenges in a temperature sensor. The complementary current-temperature characteristics are exploited to generate a constant current reference for attack detection. Experimental results show that our sensor is capable of detecting an under-powering attack from a significant signal vibration in the constant current reference. Furthermore, our sensor can detect an active analog Trojan by analyzing substantial current deviation in a wide range of temperatures. These high sensitivities against the under-powering and analog Trojan attacks make the sensor resilient against attacks at the circuit level.

However, the capability of precise positioning and obstacle avoidance for autonomous driving often rely on accurate and dense point cloud images. In particular, the environment in the metropolitan area is relatively complex and there are many viaducts and expressways in modern cities. The spatial features obtained from flat roads are no longer sufficient. If we can obtain the features of higher buildings or higher landforms, a better positioning information and security can be provided when autonomous vehicles are driving on expressways or elevated roads. In addition, the high density of vehicles in the metropolitan area and vision blind spots of vehicles also form a great safety concern for autonomous driving. In order to provide higher density point cloud information so that autonomous driving can ensure the accuracy and safety of navigation and positioning when operating in metropolitan areas, we propose in this paper a data acquisition platform base on multi-LiDAR (VLP-16) as well as a data calibration and fusion algorithm to solve the problems of vision blind spots, low vertical resolution, and sparse high-level point clouds in most of the LiDAR-based system. The proposed system adopts the industrial computer (IPC) of x86 architecture and Robotic Operating System (ROS) for overall operation. In addition, the homogeneous transformation is applied for the calibration and fusion of multi-Lidar point cloud coordinate system. Experimental results have proved that the proposed system can obtain reliable point cloud data, effectively improve the vertical resolution of the point cloud, and increase the point cloud density by more than three times, which can effectively improve the positioning reliability of autonomous driving in metropolitan areas.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181581","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181581","","Point cloud compression;Roads;Urban areas;Data acquisition;Data integration;Computer architecture;Safety","","","","18","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The feature set is converted to temporally-coded spikes before being fed to the SCNN classifier. Thanks to the asynchronous spike-based multiplier-less operation, the SCNN significantly reduces the classification computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. The developed algorithm was validated on a publicly available dataset and an average sensitivity of 83.02%, a specificity of 86.31%, and a false positive rate of 0.69/hr were achieved for cross-patient seizure detection. Our results show that a 1-bit Integer-Net leads to less than 2% drop in sensitivity compared with a 32-bit real-value resolution CNN model while offering more than 27× improvement in memory efficiency. The SCNN achieves an estimated energy efficiency of $1.28\mu\mathrm{J}$ /classification, which translates into a 98.6% improvement compared to a conventional CNN implementation with the same accuracy.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181879","spiking neural network (SNN);electroencephalogram (EEG);seizure detection;cross-patient;neuromorphic;energy-efficient;computational cost;epilepsy","Sensitivity;Neuromorphics;Memory management;Sensitivity and specificity;Feature extraction;Energy efficiency;Robustness","","8","","25","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is achieved by using all sample data from the ping-pong sub-sampling phase detector as opposed to only every second point, which enables the charge pump to run pseudo-continuous. This virtually raises the reference frequency by a factor of two, which is beneficial for the phase noise performance of the phase-locked loop while fulfilling the requirements for bandwidth of reference buffers, switches etc. Furthermore, eliminating the pulser enables a highly power-efficient charge pump design, leveraging higher SSPLL FoM. The proposed charge pump is implemented in a 22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator technology.

In this paper, we introduce a novel Memristor-based Oscillator (MBO) circuit design that implements both artificial neurons and artificial synapses in the same MBO-based medium, addressing scalability issues. The circuit design is transistor-free and simple, allowing high integration density. We utilize passive unipolar memristor devices based on the JART memristor model to design MBO neurons, which have been shown to reproduce bio-plausible spiking and bursting activities. Moreover, the MBO circuit is also realized as an artificial synapse incorporating synapse and axon mechanisms. Finally, the MBO neurons are modeled as Parkinson-related neuron types and their direct bidirectional coupling demonstrates that MBO neurons are effective in driving spiking activity in non-externally stimulated MBO neurons.

Memristor based crossbars drew attention by computing the vector-matrix calculation intensive tasks such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in one time step. Although they provide an energy efficient way of computing these tasks, analog computation in general suffers from non-idealities and systematic errors in the circuitry, which could degrade the performance and accuracy significantly. One of the issues is the random offset associated with the op-amps in the system resulting from the process and mismatch variations. In this paper, a novel technique is offered to reduce the negative effects of the random offset and increase the output accuracy. This newly proposed system uses minimum extra circuitry and additional power consumption and only requires the crossbar to be enlarged by two extra rows. The intrinsic issue of the analog crossbars, interconnect parasitics, must be incorporated into the problem, and a way to separate the offset and wire resistance issues from each other is offered. The functionality of the system has been shown with a case study in the results section where the op-amps have $\sigma_{offset}=3mV$. The effectiveness of the offered technique demonstrates a 6× better accuracy with the mitigation of the offset problem.

Then, we have innovatively designed the algorithm into a new hardware sampler: LOCS. Finally, we have conducted a thorough comparison to showcase the efficiency of the proposed sampler, e.g., the proposed LOCS involves 66.7% less latency time than the state-of-the-art design $(n=17,669)$ while remaining constant-time operation.

However, the aggregation of GNN models has not accounted for circuit hierarchies. In addition, the generalization of GNNs to distinguish between different circuit topologies is not currently provided, which raises the question of whether one GNN is sufficient to simultaneously model differing circuit graphs. In this work, a graph representation is proposed, based on a given circuit netlist, to model analog circuits at the transistor level. Additional categorical features are included to address the ambiguity in modeling the connections of the terminals of a given transistor. Edge-conditioned convolution (ECC) is utilized, where weight matrices conditioned on the edge attributes are trained in the local neighborhood of a given node. A relational graph is constructed to model groupings of devices for each level of the hierarchy provided by the designer. Each adjacency matrix of the relational graph is processed by a graph isomorphism network (GIN) layer, described as a Circuit-GIN layer, to update the node embeddings. The model consisting of an ECC layer and two Circuit-GIN layers, described as a Circuit-GNN, is trained on data from four op-amp topologies to predict four performance parameters. Results indicate that the ECC-based model outperforms a GCN-based model in the prediction of all of the performance parameters, which results from the additional edge information learned by the ECC layer. With the addition of Circuit-GIN layers, the Circuit-GNN outperforms the ECC-only model by up to 16.7% in $\boldsymbol{R}^{\mathbf{2}}$ score. Therefore, aggregation of node embeddings based on device groupings brings additional benefit to guide the GNNs in modeling the performance of analog ICs. The work also validates the expressive power of the proposed GNN model, which generates embeddings that distinguish between different circuit graphs. The generalization of GNNs renders feasible the simultaneous learning from different analog topologies.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181617","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181617","","Performance evaluation;Circuit topology;Network topology;Predictive models;Analog circuits;Graph neural networks;Data models","","2","","24","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, shared memory access across chiplets suffers from high miss penalty due to long route latency and low bandwidth of inter-chiplet interconnects. We observe that the aggregated last-level cache (LLC) miss penalty takes approximately 35% of time on data access, and that the miss is dominated by coherence miss as a result of shared reads and writes from other LLCs. To address this problem, we propose a caching manager which speculatively enforces (or discards) LLC caching via online reinforcement learning. On every invalidated cacheline, the caching manager receives the cacheline access features, evaluates the current caching policy, and makes the next caching policy adaptively. Experimental evaluation justifies that the caching manager can reduce more than 10% coherence miss and offers a 3% speedup against a state-of-the-art cache coherence protocol.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181966","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB0300900); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181966","","Adaptive systems;Protocols;Integrated circuit interconnections;Reinforcement learning;Coherence;Bandwidth;Packaging","","","","20","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A novel technique that leverages clock phase division is proposed to secure the power side channel information of a 4-bit flash ADC. The proposed technique adds randomness to decorrelate the input signal from the given power trace as the execution phase of each comparator depends on a thermometer code computed from the previous seven clock cycles. The monotonic PSA is executed on both a secured and unsecured ADC, with results indicating 1.9 bits of information leakage from an unprotected ADC and no data leakage from a protected ADC as the bit-wise accuracy is approximately 50% when secured. The monotonic PSA is more effective at attacking a flash ADC architecture than either a convolutional neural network based PSA or a correlation template PSA. The secured ADC core occupies approximately 2% more area than a non-secure ADC in a 65 nm process, and provides a sampling frequency of up to 500 MHz at a supply voltage of 1.2 V.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181331","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181331","power side-channel;ADC;side-channel attack","Resistors;Thermometers;Codes;Quantization (signal);Side-channel attacks;Voltage;Security","","1","","10","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, existing deep learning-based image compression approaches require extra convolution layers to estimate and constrain the entropy during training, which makes the network larger and may require extra bits to send information to the decoder. In this paper, we propose a new GAN for image compression with novel discriminator and generator loss functions and a simple entropy estimation approach.

The size of such data is significantly larger than that of 2-dimensional (2D) video, and its characteristics are also different from those of conventional video. Recently, MPEG standardized video-based point cloud (V-PCC) and is now developing for video-based dynamic mesh coding (V-DMC), which changes connectivity information of vertices over time. Encoding of mesh parts is divided into generation of decimated mesh and compression of displacement for mesh reconstruction. The displacement data is being compressed using a conventional video CODEC in the form of YUV. However, in YUV of displacement, there is no spatial coherence which is commonly observed in general video. Therefore, currently adopted intra-prediction based video encoding in V-DMC, where prediction is performed in unit of blocks within one frame, is not able to exploit the characteristic of displacement data and brings low compression. This paper proposes a conversion technique for displacement data to increase compression efficiency. Displacement YUVs in a group-of-frames (GOF) are changed into a single micro image (MI) to secure better coherence. In order to maximize compression efficiency, pixels in MI are reordered in a Morton-order. This Morton-ordered MI (MoMI) performs decomposition of frequencies, and ensures a smooth area composed of zero pixels as much as possible.

A compensation path with its own PGAs, programmable attenuator, and APF enables removal of electrical feedthrough within the resonator. The chip has 5 differential input paths with independent gain control, 1–2 of which are used for local feedback (to realize oscillations) while the others accept inputs from other oscillators. The chip has been fabricated in 180 nm CMOS and consumes 4.6 mW at 1.8 V. In initial tests, it is integrated with a 2 MHz quartz resonator $(Q=2000)$ to realize an oscillator with low phase noise (-117 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset). Additionally, the chip's ability to synchronize oscillators is validated via a 1:1 injection locking experiment.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182172","Feedback ASIC;MEMS-referenced oscillators;injection locking;coupled oscillators","Band-pass filters;Phase noise;Resonator filters;Transfer functions;Quartz crystals;Gain control;Synchronization","","1","","22","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a novel router architecture servicing ongoing packets in a 2-D mesh network while guaranteeing no packet drop.

If the network traffic can be accurately and timely forecasted, it can help operators relieve this pressure. However, due to the non-linearity and non-stationarity of network traffic, it's difficult to capture dynamic characteristics to obtain excellent prediction results for large number of traditional methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network combined with variational mode decomposition (VMD) for network traffic forecasting. It firstly applies VMD to decompose the time series according to frequency information, extracting nonlinear and non-stationary features in the sequence, and then LSTM exploited to capture the long-term dependencies of network traffic data. We combine the decomposition algorithm with LSTM to establish a mapping between historical network traffic data and future ones.

While UVLC suffers from background noise from sunlight, the application of UVLC has been limited to the deep ocean. To realize the UVLC in shallow water, UVLC with the maximal-ratio combining scheme applied to angle diversity receiver with multiple Photodiodes (PDs) at different angles was proposed and, in particular, the optimization of PD placement has been studied. However, as the field of view (FOV) of each PD was fixed at 90 degrees, its optimization has not been studied. Therefore, this paper investigates the optimal FOV of PDs that maximize the average SNR of a square communication area of $n$ centered at the initial position of the receiver. As a result, in an area of $k$, narrowing the FOV of the receiver with evenly distributed PDs to 25 degrees improved the average SNR by about 3 dB compared to the case where the FOV was set to 90 degrees. In the $i$ area, narrowing the FOV of the receiver with PDs placed on the sides to 75 degrees improved the average SNR by about 0.8 dB compared to the case where the FOV was set to 90 degrees.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181760","Underwater visible light communication (UVLC);Angle diversity;Maximal ratio combining;Solar noise","Oceans;Diversity reception;Receivers;Light emitting diodes;Transceivers;Photodiodes;Optimization","","","","12","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the development of mobile communication technology, indoor base stations (BSs) have been utilized and installed to match indoor signal coverage better. Thus for indoor positioning, cellular signals have emerged as a new option. Ranging through the time of arrival (TOA) is achieved by capturing cellular signals as a signal of opportunity for localization. This approach can only estimate the user equipment (UE) to BS distance when there is just one BS and cannot obtain the two-dimensional (2D) coordinates. In this paper, we combine the fingerprint positioning approach with the signal parameters acquired via cellular signal of opportunity. TOA and one-reflection path are employed as fingerprint features, and 2D localization with a single BS is achieved. A complete signal processing flow is constructed, and the ray tracing method is performed to generate the channel parameters to evaluate the proposed positioning algorithm's performance and match the practical application as closely as feasible. Using the $100\ GHz$ carrier frequency that conforms to the sixth generation (6G) communication for simulation, the mean positioning error is $0.312 m$ when the fingerprint interval is $0.5 m$.

This bottleneck can be solved by in-memory computing (IMC), where computation is performed directly within the memory, thus eliminating the constant data shuttling between the memory and the processing unit.

This study focuses on optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in a rolling shutter based VLC for further high-speed data rates. Because an image sensor is employed, conventional optical OFDM, such as DC-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM), must fit in the grayscale range of 0–255 levels. Therefore, DCO-OFDM suffers from poor error performance owing to its high PAPR. To address this problem, we propose a polarity-separated transmission, in which the bipolar OFDM signal is separated into positive and negative parts and then transmitted by two LEDs simultaneously. Polarity-separated transmission is expected to double the grayscale range, i.e. 0–511, and improve error performance because it reconstructs the original bipolar signal by combining the received signals from two LEDs. We experimentally demonstrate and compare the symbol error rate (SER) performance of DCO-OFDM and polarity-separated transmissions. Consequently, polarity-separated transmission improved the SER performance by 10–2 in the fundamental frequency range of 300–700 Hz when 16-PSK was adopted for subcarrier modulation.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181518","visible light communication (VLC);rolling shutter based VLC (RS-VLC);optical OFDM;polarity-separated transmission","OFDM;Gray-scale;Optical imaging;Light emitting diodes;Optical receivers;Adaptive optics;Optical sensors","","2","","20","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the large volume of credit data and the variety of customer characteristics make the risk detection via manual expert analysis rather challenging. Additionally, previous loan risk detection approaches based on machine learning classification neglect the relations between different customers, and traditional graph neural networks lack the exploration of loan overdue patterns.

However, the current unsupervised approaches have limitations in global information perception, especially at distant objects and the boundaries of the objects. To overcome this weakness, we propose a global-aware attention model called GlobalDepth for depth estimation, which includes two essential modules: Global Feature Extraction (GFE) and Selective Feature Fusion (SFF). GFE considers the correlation among multiple channels and refines the encoder feature by extending the receptive field of the network.

To address this issue, in-memory computing is employed for their co-location, with memristive crossbar arrays playing an important role towards this goal. Motivated by the above, this work introduces a timing-based programming of a memristor crossbar array for sequence generation in Stochastic Computing (SC). Its operation principle is based on the stochastic nature of the memristor devices forming the crossbar array, where their programming is regulated by the switching probability that follows the Poisson distribution, controlled by pulse amplitude and duration. The timing-based programming of the proposed crossbar array increases the discretization levels of the output probability values, thereby offering more accurate control when compared to programming schemes that consider only the pulse amplitude. The memristor's stochasticity along with the crossbar's inherent parallelism opens the in-memory design space allowing SC elements to be used as sequences are generated efficiently. Simulation results on different programming pulse-width precisions highlight the proposed crossbar's effectiveness in sequence generation, supported by mean absolute error (MAE) results in a standard SC arithmetic operation. Process variations stemming from the crossbar array affecting the sequence generation in SC are investigated.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181967","Memristor Crossbar Array;Probabilistic Switching;Stochastic Computing;In-Memory Computing","Simulation;Memristors;Switches;Programming;Parallel processing;Control systems;In-memory computing","","1","","21","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, since money laundering on Ethereum is an emerging means, little is known about money laundering on Ethereum. To fill the gap, in this paper, we conduct an in-depth study on Ethereum money laundering networks through the lens of a representative security event on Upbit Exchange to explore whether money laundering on Ethereum has traditional traits. Specifically, we construct a money laundering network on Ethereum by crawling the transaction records of Upbit Hack. Then, we present five questions based on the traditional traits of money laundering networks.

The performance of the bit error rate (BER) and the power supply are evaluated by theoretical analysis. The results show that the power feeding performance degrades with decreasing $N$ in N -CSK, but improves with decreasing $N$ in the proposed scheme because the power feeding performance improves with increasing $N$. This is because, in the proposed method, the larger $N$ is, the fewer the number of LEDs that are lit.

The most advanced one is iWave++, which adopts multi-level lifting schemes based on convolutional neural networks. However, iWave++ still has many unresolved problems. First, the independent entropy coding of each component makes it impossible to use the correlation between components better. Secondly, additive wavelet transform limits the nonlinear ability of learnable wavelet transform. Moreover, the offline training strategy makes the iWave++ unable to adjust according to the content.

They exploit the anonymity of Ethereum accounts to perpetrate varieties of scams, the most common of which is phishing frauds. However, existing phishing detection work ignores the heterogeneity of Ethereum transaction edges. In fact, the activities on Ethereum include external transactions, internal transactions, and token transactions. Therefore, this paper proposes an Ethereum account phishing fraud detection method named HTSGCN. Based on heterogeneous transaction subnets, our method makes full use of the type and direction information contained in transactions. First, we collect Ethereum transaction data and construct a k-order heterogeneous subnet for each account. To aggregate the neighbor feature, we design a message propagation mechanism based on graph convolution network. Finally, we classify node representation vectors containing neighborhood and its own characteristics. Experimental results show that HTSGCN has a better effect on detecting phishing accounts than previous work which is based on homogeneous networks.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10182206","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973325); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10182206","","Convolution;Circuits and systems;Phishing;Image edge detection;Aggregates;Biological system modeling;Fraud","","4","","19","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the limited area of the ROV, it is hard to increase the number of transmitter LEDs installed on the ROV, resulting in a lower communication speed. We have developed a propeller-type rotary LED transmitter (P-RTx) to solve this problem, assuming that the LEDs are attached to the ROV's thruster. P-RTx is a device that increases communication speed by rotating a blinking LED that transmits data and utilizing the receiver's ability to capture their blinking lights as multiple afterimages.

Most existing phishing scam detection methods abstract accounts on Ethereum as nodes and transactions as edges, then use manual statistics of static node features to obtain node embedding and finally identify phishing scams through classification models. However, these methods can not dynamically learn new Ethereum transactions. Since the phishing scams finished in a short time, a method that can detect phishing scams in real-time is needed. In this paper, we propose a streaming phishing scam detection method. To achieve streaming detection and capture the dynamic changes of Ethereum transactions, we first abstract transactions into edge features instead of node features, and then design a broadcast mechanism and a storage module, which integrate historical transaction information and neighbor transaction information to strengthen the node embedding. Finally, the node embedding can be learned from the storage module and the previous node embedding.

In this paper, an effective background subtraction approach, namely NeSe, for tiny energy-harvested sensors is proposed leveraging non-volatile memory (NVM). Using the developed software/hardware method, the accuracy and efficiency of event detection can be adjusted at runtime by changing the precision depending on the application's needs. Due to the near-sensor implementation of background subtraction and NVM usage, the proposed design reduces the data movement overhead while ensuring intermittent resiliency. The background is stored for a specific time interval within NVMs and compared with the next frame. If the power is cut, the background remains unchanged and is updated after the interval passes.

Despite its success, compression of the motion representation has been less investigated in the literature. In this work, we propose a novel principal component analysis (PCA)-based decomposing method to fully exploit the compression potential of motion representations. In particular, we decompose the derived motion affine matrices into three parts and apply quantization and entropy estimation to each part in a different way depending on its significance. Using such compressed-friendly motion representations allows for preserving most of the motion information and achieving lower coding costs.

However, the impact of padding has not been studied thoroughly. Most previous studies ignore padded images in the training process. In this paper, we analyze the impact of padding on compression performance. Then, we propose a padding-aware training (PAT) strategy, handling the padding effect during the training. Specifically, our PAT strategy calculates the loss of pre-padding image through a masking operation. Finally, according to our systematic experimental results, we find that images with different resolutions tend to favor different padding modes. Therefore, we further propose to conduct padding mode decision in the encoding process for rate-distortion optimization. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed PAT strategy and padding mode decision effectively compensate for the performance drop caused by padding.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181476","learned image compression;padding-aware training;padding effect","Training;Image coding;Image resolution;Systematics;Circuits and systems;Rate-distortion;Optimization","","1","","22","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditionally, memristor-based accelerators are equipped with selector elements to reduce cross-talk through sneak paths along unselected lines. However, due to the large drive strength required for selector elements, it comes at the cost of synaptic crossbar density. Selector- less alternatives require careful design of crossbar peripheral circuits to mitigate or eliminate sneak path-induced cross-talk. We propose a hybrid integrated platform that interfaces a selector- less memristor crossbar array with peripheral row and column instrumentation for array-parallel programming and readout for AI learning and inference applications. The proposed switched-capacitor voltage-sensing instrumentation avoids the need for current-sensing schemes with voltage-clamped sense lines that are typically used to mitigate the sneak path issues in selector- less crossbars but are substantially less energy-efficient than voltage-sensing. Our board-level platform is implemented using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) data converters and switched capacitors, and is controlled by a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA. The system offers programmable sense times to characterize memristors over a wide range of resistances and the capability to switch between a transient-domain measurement and steady-state measurement to offer the desired trade-off between accuracy and energy efficiency during inference parallel readout. We implement a differential weight-encoding scheme to improve the accuracy of matrix-vector multiplication. The system also supports an array-level programming scheme for parallel write access as well as online learning-in-memory for neuromorphic applications through outer-product incremental decomposition of the weight matrix. Thus, our system offers a generic, user-configurable, and versatile platform to support wide dynamic range measurements of synaptic crossbar arrays and cognitive neuromorphic computing with emerging non-volatile memory devices.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181867","Neuromorphic computing;memristors;voltage-sensing;matrix-vector-multiplication;incremental outer-product-learning","Nonvolatile memory;Instruments;Memristors;Energy measurement;Switches;Programming;Energy efficiency","","3","","8","USGov","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, a synaptic element based on a memristive bridge, containing two resistors and two memristors, is studied, aiming to investigate complex memristor-based topologies that may result in rich synaptic dynamics. The proposed memristive bridge allows the realization of both positive and negative synaptic weights, while an asymmetric tuning of a weight, stemming from memristor's features and bridge topology, is demonstrated. In particular, by properly selecting the memristor's position and polarity within the bridge, different tuning behaviors have been observed, showcasing versatile learning properties of the topology. Along with the synaptic weight tuning, the read overall process of the synaptic weight, necessary for inference operations, is also investigated. We explore the dynamics of the bridge via numerical simulations.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181704","memristors;memritive devices;memristive synaptic bridge","Circuits and systems;Bridge circuits;Memristors;External stimuli;Numerical simulation;Biology;Topology","","","","42","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Establishing thermal covert channels is feasible because modern processors have accessible temperature sensors that are typically used for dynamic thermal management. In this paper, we first provide an information-theoretic discussion on thermal cover channels and important characteristics such as channel capacity and data modulation methods. Next, we summarize existing thermal covert channel detection methods, including their limitations. We then propose a novel runtime detection method for thermal covert channels where the secret data is encoded via low power programs. Our results demonstrate that the proposed technique can achieve 100% detection accuracy with 0% false positive rate.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181920","","Temperature sensors;Runtime;Program processors;Multicore processing;Circuits and systems;Channel capacity;Modulation","","1","","27","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While inference involves recall using a fixed or learned set of parameters that can be energy-optimized using compression and sparsification techniques, training involves searching over the entire set of parameters and hence requires repeated memorization, caching, pruning, and annealing. In this paper, we introduce three “performance walls” that determine the training energy efficiency, namely, the memory-wall, the update-wall, and the consolidation-wall. While the emerging compute-in-memory ML architectures can address the memory-wall bottleneck (or energy-dissipated due to repeated memory access) the approach is agnostic to energy-dissipated due to the number and precision required for the training updates (the update-wall) and is agnostic to the energy-dissipated when transferring information between short-term and long-term memories (the consolidation-wall). To overcome these performance walls, we propose a learning-in-memory (LIM) paradigm that prescribes ML system memories with metaplasticity and whose thermodynamical properties match the physics and energetics of learning.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181597","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:FET-2208770); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181597","Machine Learning;Training;Neuromorphic Systems;Energy Efficiency;Memory;Thermodynamics","Training;Annealing;Neuromorphics;Circuits and systems;Memory management;Machine learning;Energy efficiency","","1","","13","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have enabled au-tonomous navigation while using captured data by drone sensors as input to the model. Due to the extreme complexity of DNNs, cloud-based approaches have been highly addressed in which a drone is connected to the cloud and sends the data to the cloud, and takes the result. On the other hand, emerging tiny machine learning models and edge computing brings significant improvement in energy efficiency and latency with respect to cloud-based approaches. However, there is a trade-off in these two implementations for model accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency. For instance, applying tiny machine learning models leads to lower latency but it sacrifices model accuracy in comparison to cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, we consider multiple models and introduce a new approach named MLAE2 which applies Metareasoning approach for Latency-Aware Energy-Efficient autonomous drones. Metareasoning mon-itors parameters such as latency and energy consumption for different algorithms and chooses the appropriate algorithm due to the environmental situation changes. To Evaluate our approach we extract the power consumption and latency for both cloud-based computing and edge computing while deploying multiple models on a tiny drone named Crazyflie. The experimental results show that MLAE2 successfully meets the latency constraint while maximizing model accuracy and improving energy efficiency.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10181715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181715","Metareasoning;Tiny Machine Learning;Au-tonomous Systems;Obstacle Avoidance;Drone Navigation","Power demand;Navigation;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Artificial neural networks;Energy efficiency;Sensors","","7","","33","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ""split ADC"" architecture is exploited to eliminate the signal interference and accelerate the convergence speed of the calibration. The output difference of two channels continuously drives the background calibration algorithm to estimate and correct the error caused by nonlinearities. To guarantee the validity of calibration with different inputs, shuffling scheme is adopted in capacitor array. Different dither signals are injected into two channels to achieve faster convergence, especially under the DC input. In the meanwhile, enough redundancy is introduced to capacitor array to avoid the decrease of input range caused by dither signal. A 4-bit coarse ADC is exploited to alleviate conversion time and provide dither injection. A behavior level model with various nonideal factors is established in MATLAB to prove the availability of calibration for an 18-bit pipelined-SAR ADC. The simulation shows that the ENOB achieves 16.5-bit, the SNDR is increased from 52.4 dB to 100.9 dB and the SFDR is improved from 72.3 dB to 119.6 dB.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-5109-3","10.1109/ISCAS46773.2023.10195888","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Tsinghua University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10195888","ADC;pipelined-SAR ADC;digital background calibration;split ADC;dither injection","Simulation;Capacitors;Redundancy;Mathematical models;Calibration;Registers;Resource management;Convergence;Signal to noise ratio;Matlab","","4","","9","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A voltage-mode control scheme with an instant Tzcd and $\text{Tsw}/2$ mirror is employed in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). It avoids negative inductor current in DCM and improves efficiency in light load with minimized voltage ripples. Meanwhile, a current-mode control scheme is used in continuous conduction mode (CCM), sharing a single feedback controller and $\text{Tsw}/2$ mirror controller with DCM. The inherent time difference of detection cycles between DCM and CCM is used to realize a seamless dual-mode transition. The converter is designed with a conversion for 12.0 V to 1.0 V at 1-MHz switching frequency, based on a $0.15-{\mu m}$ high-voltage BCD process. The simulation shows that a power efficiency of 79.8% is achieved with a dual-mode control under a 200-mA current load, which is the 7.2% higher than the counterpart without dual-mode control.
