The power supply nodes of the inverters in a ring oscillator are sorted in two sets, and connected to two different input signals. We show in this paper that the oscillator frequency of such configuration reacts to the product of the two inputs. Therefore, the ring oscillator can be used both as a mixer and to digitally acquire the lowpass converted component. A first system-level approach is made to optimize the distortion by a proper number of taps in the ring oscillator. To confirm the system level predictions, some circuit simulations have been made. As a result, it is observed that VCO non-linearity limits the SNDR in a similar way as in conventional low pass VCOADCs. In a 65nm CMOS process, 55 dB of SNDR is achieved in a 5-MHz bandwidth for a 1 MHz downconverted signal, using a sampling clock of 2.5 GHz and input signals centered in 70 MHz and 71 MHz.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937797","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937797","Analog to digital converter;voltage controlled oscillators;radio receivers","Ring oscillators;Limiting;Power supplies;Circuit simulation;Voltage-controlled oscillators;Bandwidth;Receivers","","1","","7","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a new correlation-based technique that boosts convergence speed by orders of magnitude compared to existing autocorrelation-based techniques. The technique uses a digital window detector and calculates the signal correlation funnction around zero-crossings only.

Previous accelerators suffer from several problems, such as large memory requirements and resource underutilization. To handle the above issues, a fast algorithm for 3D DeConv (F3DC) is proposed in this paper. F3DC applies a fast algorithm to reduce the number of multiplications and achieves a significant algorithmic strength reduction. Besides, F3DC removes the extra memory requirement for overlapped partial sums and avoids computational imbalance to fully utilize resources. Moreover, we design an F3DC-based hardware architecture, which consists of four fast processing units (FPUs). Each FPU includes a pre-process module, a EWMM module and a post-process module for F3DC transformation. By implementing our design on the Xilinx VC709 platform for 3D-GAN, we achieve a throughput up to 1700 GOPS and 4× computational efficiency improvement compared with prior works.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937736","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937736","Three-Dimensional Generative Neural Networks;Deconvolution;Transposed Convolution;Hardware Architecture;Fast Algorithm","Visualization;Three-dimensional displays;Deconvolution;Memory management;Throughput;Generative adversarial networks;Hardware","","","","13","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurate measurement can be performed by extracting respiratory modulations from Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal obtained from a pulse oximeter indirectly. Respiratory rate estimates from derived modulations are fused to get robust results. However, all the three extracted modulations are not true representative of the respiration activity all the time, subject to the patient's health condition and body position. Therefore, we propose novel modulation quality indices (MQI) to check the quality of the extracted modulations before computing the RR from it. We take the mean of only those estimates which pass an empirical quality threshold. This approach increases the robustness of the mean fusion methodology. We have validated our algorithm on a publicly available dataset: benchmark dataset CapnoBase. The proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art with mean absolute errors (median, 25$^{th}$ 75$^{th}$ percentiles with 32-sec window size) of 0.4 (0.1-0.7) without discarding any PPG window, thus enabling accurate RR estimates.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937671","Lahore University of Management Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937671","Respiratory rate (RR);photoplethysmogram (PPG);respiration activity;modulation quality index (MQI)","Pulse oximeter;Pulse measurements;Wearable computers;Modulation;Estimation;Time measurement;Sensor systems","","3","","20","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A number of excellent textbooks are available that cover the theory, but it is difficult to find compelling literature that extends this knowledge to practical applications. In this paper, basic amplifier theory is revisited and with attention to considerations related to non-idealities and variations. The concept of sensitivity and its use is emphasized as well as, using the benefits of source/emitter degeneration as an example. It is shown that this degeneration indeed corresponds to an effective negative feedback mechanism that improves linearity and accuracy in addition to increasing the amplifier input impedance, all at the expense of reduced voltage gain.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937807","Electronics;design of electronic amplifiers;amplifier sensitivity;design for robustness","Temperature sensors;Temperature distribution;Sensitivity;Negative feedback;Monte Carlo methods;Education;Voltage","","","","8","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Frequency-shift keying (FSK) is a robust data modulation scheme with negligible sensitivity to amplitude noise and movements of the transmitter and receiver coils of an inductive link. However, achieving efficient transmission of power while modulating FSK has always been a difficult task, because high data rate FSK requires a broadband modulator. In this paper, we propose a narrowband FSK transceiver scheme, which enables WPDT link to transmit power efficiently when transmitting data. Using this approach, the power transfer efficiency (PTE) and the power delivered to the load (PDL) were measured to be 51.92% and 92.42 mW, respectively. With carrier frequencies of 3.952 and 4.516 MHz, the WPDT link we have implemented can transmit data at a rate of 564.48 kbps, with a 5.35$-\mu$H transmitter coil and a 0.7$-\mu$H receiver coil. The transmitter SoC is fabricated in a 0.18$-\mu$m CMOS technology and occupies 2 mm2. We also designed the corresponding demodulation circuit, of which power consumption is 8.49 uW.

By exploiting generalized dual ciphers, alternative conversions are utilized to substantially simplify all the involved constant matrix multiplications. Additionally, a multiplicative masking scheme utilizing simple constant multipliers is developed for AES designs used in resource-constraint applications. FPGA implementation results on a Xilinx XC7a200t device show that the proposed design with four Sboxes achieves 11.1% area reduction and 89.2% clock frequency increase compared to the best prior architecture without sacrificing CPA-attack resistance.

With the layer-wise mixed-precision networks where the different precision scheme is applied to each layer, we can reduce off-chip memory bandwidth requirements as well as hardware complexity while retaining model accuracy [3]. However, it takes a long time to determine the optimal precision scheme for each layer due to the repetitive trainings with the different precision configurations.

This paper introduces an efficient parallelization strategy for optical flow computation targeting new-generation multicore low power RISC-V based microcontroller units. Our approach enables higher frame rates at lower clock speeds. It has been implemented and evaluated on the eight-core cluster of a commercial octa-core MCU (GAP8) reaching a parallelization speedup factor of 7.21 allowing for a frame rate of 500 frames per second when running on a 50MHz clock frequency.

The acceleration solutions available today are typically for GPU, CPU, FPGA and ASIC platforms. The Single Partial Product 2-D Convolution known as SPP2D is a hardware architecture for fast 2-D convolution which can be used for implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN). The SPP2D based CNNs prevent the re-fetching of input pixels for the calculation of partial products and it computes the output for any input size and kernel with low latency and low power consumption compared to some other popular techniques. SPP2D based VGGNet-16 rivals the performance of other existing implementations as well as a FFO based CNN architecture which takes a novel approach to compute convolution results using row-wise inputs as opposed to traditional tile-based processing. In this paper, we present an SPP2D based hardware accelerator for a channel compressed network. We find that the low power SPP2D implementation gives a better performance in terms of low power and low execution time compared to other compressed contemporary designs. A compressed network requires less on-chip memory thus reducing the most power consuming task of moving data from off-chip to on-chip. This results in a considerable reduction in power consumption due to the reduction in memory traffic.

The architecture consists of light-weight cores interconnected by caches and crossbars that support run-time reconfiguration between different cache modes - shared or private, different dataflow modes - systolic or parallel, and different computation mapping schemes.

SNRmax can be further improved by choosing devices with higher resistive contrast Roff/Ron, e.g., FeFET, but only until it attains a value in the range 12-15.

Recently proposed learning algorithms for the placement problem consider only 2D ICs and still exhibit memory issues and learning problems in large search spaces. RS3DPlace uses the learning ability of RL to quickly estimate a preliminary solution, which SA later uses to generate an improved final solution. To address memory issues, RS3DPlace uses the approximate method for state representation which reduces the memory complexity and allows more than one kind of perturbation to improve learning efficiency in large search spaces. The current implementation is for the gate-level M3D design style, but it can be extended to other M3D design styles and other 2D and 3D physical design optimization problems.

However, existing methods usually consider an input video as a whole and learn models, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with coarse video-level class labels. These methods can only output an action class for the video, but cannot provide fine-grained and explainable cues to answer why the video shows a specific action. Therefore, researchers start to focus on a new task, Part-level Action Parsing (PAP), which aims to not only predict the video-level action but also recognize the frame-level fine-grained actions or interactions of body parts for each person in the video. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine framework for this challenging task. In particular, our framework first predicts the video-level class of the input video, then localizes the body parts and predicts the part-level action. Moreover, to balance the accuracy and computation in part-level action parsing, we propose to recognize the part-level actions by segment-level features. Furthermore, to overcome the ambiguity of body parts, we propose a pose-guided positional embedding method to accurately localize body parts.

Hysteretic power supplies are appealing in this respect because they respond quickly. But how fast and reliably they respond depends on design, which hinges on understanding. This paper uses and develops insight to explain and analyze the feedback dynamics and stability requirements of hysteretic current-mode dc-dc switched-inductor converters, which are largely abstract and algebraic in literature today.

This paper presents an analysis of the factors influencing the ISG and proposes measures, which can be used to maximize it. Most importantly, it is shown, that the CIFB DSM architecture is preferred, since the wideband residue overloads the CIFF architecture with its peaking OOB STF much earlier, thus CIFB results in more ISG and less internal swings.

In this paper, two bitwise ELD compensation approaches applicable to cascade-of-integrators with distributed feedback (CIFB) loop filters are proposed, which alleviate this problem for SAR and other multi-step quantizers by sequentially feeding bits into the feedback loop when they are available (MSB first, LSB last).

Using single-bit quantizers in Sigma-Delta modulators (SDMs) is very common due to their inherent linearity. However, their binary feedback increases the requirements for the integrators and the jitter sensitivity in the loop compared to multi-bit feedback. FIR feedback tries to resolve these problems, however, requires a second compensating FIR filter and an adjusted loopfilter scaling in order to restore the original noise transfer characteristic. This not only makes the design process more challenging but also leads to increased peaking of the STF, undesirable for many applications. Therefore, in this work a heuristic-search based design approach is presented which offloads work from the designer to an automated design environment. It allows to design CT SDMs directly in the CT domain including the compensation of nonidealities and STF engineering in order to counteract the peaking.

It consists of a reading coil and an array of six resonators, tuned at different frequencies ranging from 100 MHz to 180 MHz, generating multiple frequency bifurcations. The shifts/changes of resonance frequencies are proportional to the changes in the electromagnetic properties of the surrounding environment of the resonators.

Unfortunately, it was found that this input-referred noise was dependent on the driving impedance. In the prior study only ideal voltage and ideal current control were elaborated. In this work, we generalize the VCO noise model for an arbitrary driving impedance. This enables the noise optimization of a VCO with an arbitrary driving circuit which was not possible with the prior theory. In this work we present such a noise optimization for the linearizing resistive VCO drive circuit of [2], [3].

Thus, the sensor includes pre-processing capabilities like frequency decomposition, nonlinear amplification of signals and adaptation of sensing properties to varying acoustic inputs. The integration of the adaptation mechanism into the sensor system not only enhances important sound features like sound onset but also increases its dynamic range by increasing sensitivity for low volume sounds and preventing saturation for large volume sounds.

Most existing learning-based video compression models adopt the traditional hybrid-based coding architecture, which involves temporal prediction followed by residual coding. However, recent studies have shown that residual coding is suboptimal from the information-theoretic perspective. In addition, most existing models are optimized with respect to RGB content. Furthermore, they require separate models for variable-rate coding. To address these issues, this work presents an attempt to incorporate the conditional inter-frame coding for YUV 4:2:0 content. We introduce a conditional flow-based inter-frame coder to improve the inter-frame coding efficiency. To adapt our codec to YUV 4:2:0 content, we adopt a simple strategy of using space-to-depth and depth-to-space conversions. Lastly, we employ a rate-adaption net to achieve variable-rate coding without training multiple models. Experimental results show that our model performs better than x265 on UVG and MCL-JCV datasets in terms of PSNR-YUV. However, on the more challenging datasets from ISCAS’22 GC, there is still ample room for improvement. This insufficient performance is due to the lack of inter-frame coding capability at a large GOP size and can be mitigated by increasing the model capacity and applying an error propagationaware training strategy.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937505","video compression;YUV format;variable rate;conditional inter-frame coding","Training;Adaptation models;Codecs;Circuits and systems;Video compression;Predictive models;Encoding","","6","","21","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was developed for sensor excitation, however, the concept is applicable wherever a precise digitally-controlled current source is required. The current source is based on a two-stage cascaded $\Delta \Sigma$ modulator using a current-steering digital-to-analog converter and a novel current amplifier that generates a scaled replica of the output current of the DAC. The D/A conversion is done by 64 unary current cells that are controlled by a timing optimized switch driver. To reduce the flicker noise the current cells are chopped using two banks of current cells, that are activated alternatingly. The proposed fully differential current amplifier uses only a single operational amplifier to deliver a filtered and scaled output current. Thus the typically required intermediate transimpedance amplifier is eliminated, which results in an increased noise performance and a reduced power consumption. The current source has a simulated total harmonic distortion of 99.5dB and a simulated signal-to-noise ratio of 116dB.

At present, most of the existing ecological measurement and control systems of grain depots still use the traditional manual trigger IoT sensing and acquisition mode. The cable array has problems such as single point of failure, insufficient density, and a long time for one measurement. In addition, the heat capacity of the warehouse wall is easy to cause heat accumulation in the outer ring of the grain pile, and the temperature change lags behind.

In this paper, we present an SCBSS methodology using a state-parameter estimation approach to eliminate the constraints on the source signals such as statistical independence and frequency disjoint spectra. A Dual Square Root Unscented Kalman Filter (D-SRUKF) estimator has been proposed, which demonstrates higher numerical accuracy and improved stability compared to the widely used Dual Extended Kalman Filter (D-EKF). Simulations have been performed for separating mixed signals with overlapping spectra such as speech and biomedical signals. The proposed methodology demonstrates higher Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) and Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) when the current methodologies even fail to separate the sources. The results also show that the proposed DSRUKF SCBSS is 15% more accurate than the state-of-the-art D-EKF SCBSS and has higher stability owing to the square root formulation of D-SRUKF source estimator.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937287","Single channel Blind Source Separation;Dual Square Root Unscented Kalman Filter;State-Parameter Estimation","Scalp;Estimation;Channel estimation;Stability analysis;Frequency estimation;Blind source separation;Circuit stability","","","","19","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper investigates the delay behavior of a range of exact and incomplete parallel-prefix addition trees under variations, including speculative/approximate trees and trees with duplicated prefix nodes. The performance of a range of incomplete adder variants is investigated comparatively with conventional exact architectures at a 16-nm technology node. In order to capture variations generated from a range of process-dependent sources and their impact on delay characteristics, the analysis considers threshold voltage variations employing Spice-level simulations. Under nominal voltage and in the presence of threshold variations, incomplete architectures are found to still offer a smaller worst-case delay than their exact counterparts; similarly for a low-voltage scenario, where the supply voltage is reduced to 0.8 V. However, focusing on normalized delay variation, it is here found that incomplete-tree adders are more susceptible to variations as they show a wider delay spread than exact architectures around their respective mean values. As a remedy, it is shown that the number of stages in an incomplete adder can be used as a design parameter to investigate accuracy vs. variability-tolerance trade-offs. Furthermore, by duplicating delay-critical paths of prefix trees, worst-case delay and standard deviation reduce compared to the exact architectures.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937629","parallel-prefix adders;speculative adders;arithmetic circuits;delay variations;threshold voltage variations","Low voltage;Sensitivity;Monte Carlo methods;Circuits and systems;Focusing;Threshold voltage;Delays","","","","26","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, neural networks optimally trained on data from the source technology node are adopted as pre-trained models. During transfer training, the front layers of the pre-trained models are frozen while the remaining layers are re-trained with significantly less data in the target technology node. The transfer learning technique is applied to the prediction of seven performance metrics of an operational amplifier based on seven design variables that include the sizing of transistors and capacitors. Models trained on a dataset containing 1602 simulated design points from a 180 nm process are transferred to predict the performance metrics of the op-amp utilizing only 100 simulated design points from a 65 nm process. During the training of the transferred models, the learning curve exhibits an improved starting point and a lower asymptotic error. Utilizing the same training set of 100 points from the 65 nm process, applying transfer learning reduces the normalized mean average error (MAE) on the test (inference) set in all cases by up to 50% as compared to training standalone models. For the transferred models, a detailed characterization of the test error as a function of the number of frozen layers is performed. Results indicate that the transferred gain predictor trained with only 100 data points provides a lower test error than the standalone model trained with 1000 data points without transfer learning in a 65 nm process. Therefore, transfer learning improves the sample efficiency of the training of the neural networks used for the prediction of the performance parameters of a circuit, which provides benefit for design migration when the collection of new circuit data is computationally costly in the target process node.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937457","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937457","","Training;Measurement;Operational amplifiers;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Neural networks;Predictive models","","5","","12","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The overhead in performance due to the parasitic impedance of the routing switches is analyzed at the internal nodes connected to the programming switches. Advantages of topology obfuscation include the generation of a large search space, an uncorrelated output response, and flexibility in circuit design. The circuits implemented on the FPAA include an op amp with varying loads, a second order biquad filter, a ring-oscillator, and a frequency divider. For circuits requiring a single configurable analog block (CAB) on the FPAA, the 3 dB bandwidth is maintained around 1 GHz, while circuits requiring multiple CABs operate with frequencies between 200 MHz and 1.5 GHz. The security provided by the FPAA fabric is evaluated on both single CAB implementations as well as multi-CAB circuits. Two attack scenarios are considered, a brute force attack and a topology attack. The multi-CAB circuit provides strong security robustness to both attacks with a minimum search space of 226 for the brute force attack and 210 for the topology attack.

These factors significantly increase the difficulty of the cell segmentation task due to image distortion and complex backgrounds.

Emerging technologies (like RRAMs) have meanwhile shown a real promise to address the increasing challenges of the conventional computing technology. While the main direction of research is focussing on exploiting the analogue memory attributes of RRAMs specially for analogue computing crossbars [3], this paper focuses on a different perspective of building high-density and digital-friendly RRAM-based memory that is a good alternative to the SRAM-based Last-Level Caches LLCs. This digital RRAM-based memory with conventional 1T1R bit-cells is proposed to be an on-chip gigantic data reservoir, with much higher density than SRAMs, to bridge the memory gap. The paper also shows that the digital RRAM-based memory is capable of doing robust bit-line compute which opens the door for digital in-memory computing architectures that can mitigate the Von Neumann bottleneck while adopting RRAM’s high-density promise.

Traditionally, level shifters have been characterized using energy-delay curves (or correspondingly the energy-delay product) [2]. All the aforementioned applications provide the level shifter’s higher supply voltage through an external pin. Also, the primary objective in the previously mentioned applications has been reduction in energy consumption. Thus, energy-delay product is an appropriate figure-of merit (FOM) for these applications. However, unlike these applications certain analog/mixed signal(AMS) applications like that in [4] employ charge-pumps to generate the higher supply voltages. The FOM of energy-delay product is no longer appropriate in these cases for two reasons. First, the use of energy delay curves to characterize and choose the appropriate level shifter architecture ignores the energy consumed by the charge pumps to generate the higher voltages and can eventually lead to an overall larger energy consumption. Secondly, since the current from the higher voltage is provided through a charge reservoir (capacitor in most cases), voltage droop during switching should also be accounted by the FOM. Optimizing the energy-delay product does not account for this effect. We therefore argue that charge-delay product (or correspondingly the charge-delay curves) is a better FOM to compare level shifters to be used in such applications. The “charge” of concern here refers to the charge consumed through the higher supply voltage. One might argue that charge-delay optimization is equivalent to energy-delay optimization. However, we would like to emphasize the fact that our objective is to obtain the optimization between the charge consumed from the higher supply voltage and the delay of the level shifter. This FOM allows for trading off higher energy consumption from the lower supply voltage for a lower charge consumption from the higher supply voltage.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937694","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937694","","Energy consumption;Charge pumps;Stacking;Voltage;Switches;Reservoirs;Delays","","","","4","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this, we propose a multimodal attentive learning framework that keeps track of spatio-temporal states of the participants and their conversation dynamics.

Therefore, pruning, quantization, data sparsity and data reuse have been applied to DNNs to reduce memory and computation complexity at the expense of some accuracy loss. The reduction in the bit-precision results in loss of information, and the aggressive bit-width reduction could result in noticeable accuracy loss. This paper introduces Scaling-Weight-based Convolution (SWC) technique to reduce the DNN model size and the complexity and number of arithmetic operations. This is achieved by, using a small set of high-precision weights (maximum absolute weight “MAW”) and a large set of low-precision weights (Scaling weights “SWs”). This results in decreasing the model size with minimum loss in accuracy compared to simply reducing the precision. Moreover, a scaling and quantized network-acceleration processor (SQNAP) is proposed based on the SWC method to achieve high-speed and low-power with reduced memory accesses. The proposed SWC eliminate >90% of the multiplications in the network. Moreover, the less important SWs are pruned, which has a small portion of the MAW.

Fingerprint datasets (databases) for minutiae extraction are beneficial to improve the performance of subsequent indexing and matching tasks, particularly combined with advanced deep learning technique. However, the learning-based methods are restricted by the limitation of public labeled datasets due to legitimate privacy concerns. To thoroughly address these issues (composed of lacking of the available databases and general annotation technique), a novel fingerprint image labeling approach is first focused on in this paper. Specifically, we devise a knowledge-oriented minutiae annotation method, which consists of image segmentation, normalization, orientation and frequency estimations, enhancement, binarization, thining, minutiae extraction, deleting redundancy and then revising the wrong annotations manually. Next, a minutiae database is created via the approach, and then experiments verify its effectiveness for training deep learning model. Comprehensive experimental results on two datasets manifest the ability of the constructed database to improve the prediction accuracy of CNN (achieving precision and recall up to 89.97% and 88.38%, respectively) compared with public software and other similar deep learning extraction model which in turn reveals the effectiveness of our method.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937790","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937790","Fingerprint image;minutiae;image morphology processing;orientation and frequency knowledge;CNN","Deep learning;Training;Databases;Annotations;Image matching;Software algorithms;Morphology","","","","21","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A straightforward derivation of these complex (trans-)impedances requires making suitable numerical tools available to designers. In this paper, we compute these impedances with the periodic small-signal analysis, a novel numerical approach in the power system realm.

Moreover, such pruning algorithms should be adapted to certain hardware requirements, such as the use of tiling. Therefore, in this work, we leverage the use of the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation sampling to structurally prune tiles, which benefits further hardware implementations, and additionally allows to jointly optimize with quantization.

Increasing crossbar size to further enhance computation/power efficiency can only be achieved on the premise that those problems can be solved. This work proposes a charge-transfer-based crossbar, where the accumulation is performed by counting the transferred charges into capacitors. Thanks to the time-discrete property of the charge transfer and adaptive body-biasing (ABB) current generator, the entire proposed crossbar is almost fully dynamic and very insensitive to parasitic wire resistance without DAC/ADC needed. In addition, adaptive reference technique is applied to realize a self-adjustable operating range for quantitated neural network computations. The proposed crossbar prototype is designed with 22nm-FDSOI and post-simulated with a size of $128 \times 128$. A computation and power efficiency of 1024GOP/s and 78TOPS/w is achieved for computation with 4-bit inputs, 1-bit weight, and 4-bit output.

We show, both theoretically and with transistor-level simulations, that mode-agnostic maximum phase resolution can be ensured by selecting a prime M together with an N which is co-prime with M.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937816","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937816","cyclic-coupled ring oscillator (CCRO);phase resolution;prime;coprime;time-to-digital converter (TDC)","Ring oscillators;Semiconductor device modeling;Phase noise;Quantization (signal);Design methodology;Reliability engineering;Time-domain analysis","","1","","8","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Addressing the above challenges, we present an ultra-low-power non von-Neumann framework for statistical modeling based anomaly detection in multi-channel time-series. To disruptively minimize the power dissipation for anomaly detection and enhance scalability to complex time-series statistics, we pursue a co-designed approach where the anomaly statistics are modelled using an unconventional Harmonic-Mean of Gaussian-like (HMG) functions. We show that multivariate HMG functions can be implemented simply by exploiting the short-circuit current of multi-input inverters. A non-von Neumann crossbar of charge trap inverters implements a mixture of HMG function and stores model weights. On Yahoo real time-series dataset, our anomaly detection approach achieves an f1-score higher than 0.85 even in the presence of significant process variation and consumes 181fJ/sensor sample for a three-channel time-series. Compared to baseline digital and analog approaches for anomaly detection, our framework is $\sim 40 \times$ and $\sim 6 \times$ more energy efficient, respectively, while being more scalable to time-series dimension.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937564","","Short-circuit currents;Scalability;Inverters;Energy efficiency;Real-time systems;Power dissipation;Transistors","","","","20","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, DNNs deployed on edge devices demand very high-energy efficiency. In this context, Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is an emerging compute paradigm that bridges the memory-computation gap to improve the energy-efficiency. DRAMs are one such memory type employed for designing energy-efficient PIM architectures for DNN training. One of the major issues of DRAM-PIM architectures designed for DNN training is the high number of internal data accesses within a bank between the memory arrays and the PIM computation units (e.g. 51% more than inference). These internal data accesses in the state-of-the-art DRAM PIM architectures consume very high energy compared to computation units. Hence, it is important to reduce the internal data access energy within the DRAM bank for further improving the energy efficiency of DRAMPIM architectures. We present three novel optimizations that together reduce the internal data access energy up to 81.54%. Our first optimization modifies the bank data access circuit to enable partial accesses of data instead of the conventional fixed granularity accesses, thereby exploiting the available sparsity during training. The second optimization is to have a dedicated low-energy region within the DRAM bank that has low capacitive load of global wires and shorter data movement. Finally, we propose a 12-bit high dynamic range floating-point format called TinyFloat that reduces the total number of data access energy by 20% compared to IEEE 754 half and single precision.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937832","Processing-in-Memory;PIM;Compute-in-Memory;DRAM;DNN training","Training;Deep learning;Degradation;Circuits and systems;Neural networks;Wires;Random access memory","","4","","26","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, using a recently published dataset that contains tracking annotations for uncompressed videos, we examined the degradation of tracking accuracy due to video compression using rigorous statistical methods. Specifically, we examined the impact of quantization parameter (QP) and motion search range (MSR) on Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA). The results show that QP impacts MOTA at the 95% confidence level, while there is insufficient evidence to claim that MSR impacts MOTA.

This contention can lead to severe performance loss and has a different impact on each application, resulting in potential starvation for selected applications. Thus, there is a need for a scheduling policy to efficiently address this contention-induced unfairness.

Previously reported CMUTs-based biochemical sensors required a peripheral power source to provide a DC driving voltage (e.g.,10-50 V), which was higher than the common circuit supply (e.g., 1.2-5 V).

A limitation of conventional neuroimaging clustering methods is neglecting the potential bias caused by noise. To remove noise, we introduce adaptive regularization based on coefficient distribution modeling in transform domain. Different from traditional sparsity techniques that assume zero expectation of the coefficients, we use the data of interest to form the Laplace distributions so that they can depict the statistical characteristics more accurately. Furthermore, we use feature clusters to provide weak supervision for enhanced clustering of subjects.

The proposed design leverages the reversible logic paradigm and achieves better performance with significantly less hardware resources requirement compared to other conventional ring oscillator (RO)PUF, configurable RO (CRO), and reconfigurable (RRO) PUF designs. Quantum and comparative analysis for the R3 O PUF is discussed in this paper. The proposed R3 O PUF is able to generate more Challenge Response Pairs (CRPs) compared with state-of the-art RO PUFs with using an equal number of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) of an FPGA. R3 O PUF requires only 50% and 25% of hardware resources to generate 1-bit PUF response compared to other CRO PUFs and RRO PUFs, respectively. R3 O PUF’s results show that the proposed model is suitable for enhancing a lightweight hardware security system especially for root of trust (RoT), authentication and key generation applications and eliminating the need for trading the security with power reduction.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937354","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937354","IoT;RoT;physical unclonable function;hardware security;reversible logic","Ring oscillators;Performance evaluation;Systematics;Authentication;Physical unclonable function;Hardware;Rail to rail outputs","","4","","20","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For sufficient security and satisfactory performance, the Knuth-Yao algorithm is an efficient way to implement discrete Gaussian samplers. Nevertheless, most polynomials in lattice-based cryptography have 256 coefficients or more, which suffers from long latency to complete the sample generation. In this paper, the first parallel discrete Gaussian sampler with hierarchical structure is proposed, while keeping statistical distance to the actual distribution. Based on the imbalanced visiting frequency of the probability matrix, a three-stage generation strategy is adopted with hierarchical bit search units (BSUs) that can greatly reduce area consumption of the repeated costly lookup tables. Besides the architecture improvement, a lowest-set-bit scanning scheme is introduced to BSUs. Moreover, the parallelism of our design provides obfuscation ability against side-channel attacks (SCAs). A practical hardware implementation of discrete Gaussian distributions with $\sigma$=3.33 on the Xilinx Virtex-5 XC5VLX30 FPGA device spends 26.12 ns on average to generate 256 samples, consuming 994 slices.

Recent defense mechanisms apply hidden state transitions (HST) and logic cone modifications to a partitioned FSM to protect against both oracle-guided and structural attacks. HST triggering techniques are implemented on select state registers to induce controlled timing glitches in the FSM. However, the current implementations of HST are vulnerable to structural attack through the gate-level logic implementing the trigger. In this paper, a random walk-based security estimation metric is utilized to quantify the security of gate-level masking of the triggering topology. A novel coupling capacitance-based HST triggering topology is proposed, where the glitch is induced by manipulating the physical properties of the circuit rather than the gate-level logic. An average increase of 8.53$\times$ in the random walk-based security estimation score and an 887x increase in the geometric mean of the expected number paths to extract the key is observed for coupling capacitance based HSTs as compared to traditionally triggered HSTs. The schematic level equivalent of the proposed technique is implemented on a subset of ISCAS’89 benchmark circuits, resulting in an average overhead in area and power of 14.35% and 22.02% for all benchmark circuits and 2.23% and 1.25% for the four largest benchmark circuits, respectively, as compared to the original unobfuscated circuits.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937990","Office of Naval Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937990","logic encryption;logic locking;hardware security;sequential obfuscation","Couplings;Analytical models;Estimation;Logic gates;Benchmark testing;Capacitance;SPICE","","1","","12","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This implies stripping off all the timing information from the RTL description and generating only C/C++ code that is functionally equivalent that has arrays, loops and functions. Generating these structures is very important in order to maximize the re-optimization potential as commercial HLS tools make extensive use of synthesis directives in the form or pragmas (comments) that allow HLS users to control how to synthesize them. E.g., loops can be fully unrolled, partially unrolled or pipelined, arrays can be synthesized as registers, memories or fully expanded into individual flip-flops and functions inline or not.

Kiani",NA; NA,2022 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS),"11 Nov 2022","2022","","","1763","1767","Low-power and robust wireless communication is needed in implantable medical devices with the millimeter (mm) dimension, in which power is scarce. This paper presents an adaptive ASIC for low-power (and robust) data transmission from a mm-sized implant to an external unit using optimal number of ultrasonic (US) pulses. Any changes in the distance and alignment of a US transducer pair (for US wireless power and data transfer) can drastically vary the amplitude of the received signal. To mitigate this issue (i.e., improving robustness) and minimize the power consumption of the data transmitter, the number of transmitted US pulses is changed based on the received voltage at the external unit in the proposed closed-loop system. The proposed ASIC, designed and fabricated in a $0.35 \mu \mathrm{m}$ standard CMOS process, includes a power-management unit for rectification, regulation, and over-voltage protection of a 1.1 MHz US power carrier using only one external capacitor. The ASIC also includes a pulse-based data transmitter that can adaptively generate 1-8 pulses based on the received pattern modulated on the power carrier. Simulation results demonstrate the functionality of the ASIC in wireless power and data transfer with optimal number of pulses in the implant.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937874","National Institutes of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937874","ultrasound;wireless power and data transfer;CMOS ASIC;closed loop;data transmitter;power management","Wireless communication;Ultrasonic imaging;Transducers;Transmitters;Simulation;Implants;Data transfer","","1","","19","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Static models, however, do not always suffice for dynamic environments. On-device training of models allows for quick adaptability to new scenarios. With the increasing size of deep neural networks, as noted with the likes of BERT and other natural language processing models, comes increased resource requirements, namely memory, computation, energy, and time. Furthermore, training is far more resource intensive than inference. Resource-constrained on-device learning is thus doubly difficult, especially with large BERT-like models. By reducing the memory usage of fine-tuning, pre-trained BERT models can become efficient enough to fine-tune on resource-constrained devices.

In order to suppress DC offsets while simultaneously recording signals ranging into the sub-hertz domain, low-frequency high-pass filters are employed in the frontend of neural recording integrated circuitry. With the limited ranges of on-chip passives, no sub-hertz corner frequencies are possible. Switch-capacitor resistances and resistor duty-cycling are infeasible since these techniques cannot provide the required absolute resistance values. Concepts like multi-rate duty-cycled resistors have been successfully demonstrated, but require clock signals, which can lead to noise back-folding, especially in chopped systems. Pseudo-resistors utilize the off-resistance of MOSFETs to form extraordinary large resistors, and are thus capable of providing the required corner frequency in a very area efficient way. The drawbacks are limited linearity, and deviations of 100x over process variation and temperature were reported in prior art. In this brief we show measurement results from more than 160 dice (>5400 recording channels) from 3 production runs to demonstrate that the variations are much less severe in realistic operating conditions, and that sufficient linearity can be achieved.

However, improvements are needed for screen content coding. Most of the popular learning-based coding approaches are based on variational autoencoders employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are end-to-end trained on a training dataset. The receptive field area of the latents in these architectures increase based on the down-sampling ratio and the kernel size used in each convolution layer. The latents coded from the last layer therefore have a large receptive field size which may not be optimal to code image sources such as screen content or mixed content containing text, logos and small edges. This paper proposes new methods to adaptively fuse and code the latents from different layers. It enables a novel multi-level receptive field based latent coding architecture to achieve better coding performance for a diverse set of contents. Additionally, Multi-Mixture distribution based entropy modeling of latent features and content adaptive latent refinements in the encoder is proposed to bring more coding gains.

Meanwhile, VVC sacrifices the encoding complexity by 26 times the encoding time of HEVC, which makes it impractical to use VVC without optimization. In view of the fact that most of complexity is due to the novel block partitioning structure in VVC, this paper focuses on predicting the partitioning structure with convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we first formulate the partitioning prediction problem into two alternatives: bottom-up-based where the split type of subblock boundaries is first predicted and then used to infer the partitioning structure of each coding unit, top-down-based where the probability distribution in the ensemble partitioning space is first derived and then used to decide the partitioning structure of each coding unit. Then, we address both formulations using convolutional neural networks. When evaluating on top of VTM7.0, proposed schemes perform favorably against state-of-the-art works. In particular, the bottom-up-based method can bring on average 52.3% encoding complexity reduction with 0.46% BD-rate increase while the top-down-based method could provide on average 39.5% encoding complexity reduction with 0.28% BD-rate increase.

To tackle these challenges, we develop a unified compression framework for Vision Transformer (UCViT), whose main focus is on compressing the original ViT model by incorporating the low bit-width quantization and the dense matrix decomposition. To maximally reduce the energy expenditure, we propose a dedicated design by leveraging aggressive quantization, in which the majority of the matrix multiplications are converted to the hardware-friendly shift and addition operations. Besides, we incorporate a small module into the quantized model by harnessing the unique characteristic of multi-head attention during matrix decomposition, which achieves significant accuracy recovery from the deeply compressed model with minimal impact on the energy efficiency. Benefited from the effective fusion of different compression techniques and the hardware-friendly operations, the proposed model can save up to 98% energy consumption in inference compared to the original ViT model. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image classification tasks show that the proposed model obtains a highly compact structure with a competitive compression ratio (up to 6.7×), while causes small loss (less than 1%) on the accuracy.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937660","Vision Transformer (ViT);Image Classification;Unified Compression;Neural Network","Performance evaluation;Energy consumption;Image coding;Quantization (signal);Computational modeling;Transformers;Matrix decomposition","","3","","18","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Efficient Check Node Processing for Min-Max NB-LDPC Decoding over Lower-Order Finite Fields","X. Zhang",The Ohio State University,2022 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS),"11 Nov 2022","2022","","","2062","2066","Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes defined over non-binary (NB) finite field GF(2q)(q >1) achieve better error-correcting performance than binary LDPC codes when the codeword length is moderate. The decoder complexity increases very fast with the order of the field, 2q, although the error-correcting performance also improves. To reduce the complexity for practical applications, NB-LDPC codes over lower-order finite fields are of great interest. Previous designs have been focusing on decoders over either the smallest NB field GF (4) or much larger fields, such as GF (32) or higher. Prior optimization techniques are either not applicable or do not lead to efficient designs for codes over GF (8) or other lower-order fields. In this paper, an efficient architecture is developed for the check node processing, which is the most complicated step in NB-LDPC decoding, for the Min-max algorithm over lower-order fields. By utilizing the properties of finite field elements, the max/min comparison results are shared and the number of comparators needed is reduced significantly. Compared to the best prior design, the proposed check node processing has 18.5% smaller area and shorter critical path for an example code over GF (8).","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937813","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937813","","Circuits and systems;Focusing;Computer architecture;Parity check codes;Decoding;Complexity theory;Finite element analysis","","","","13","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are among the best candidates for error correction in the new storage class memories (SCMs). However, SCMs require short codeword length and low redundancy. In this case, the nested key equation solver (KES), which is a key step in GII decoding, has a small number of iterations. The initialization and/or scalar pre-computation in previous nested KES designs have large area and may take even longer time than the iterations themselves. This paper proposes an efficient nested KES design for short GII-BCH codes. The polynomial updating is decomposed into two steps to reduce the critical path without requiring scalar pre-computation. Besides, the KES is reformulated to reduce the number of clock cycles without incurring any area overhead. For an example code over $GF(2^{10})$ that protects 2560 bits with 10% redundancy, the proposed design achieves at least 25% area reduction and 37% reduction on the area-time product averaged over the nested decoding rounds compared to prior efforts.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937668","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937668","","Codes;Circuits and systems;Redundancy;Hardware;Decoding;Error correction;Complexity theory","","1","","11","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current optimizations often reduce dimensions to consume lower energy at the cost of degraded accuracy. In this work, we propose pruning redundant bits in the associative memory because these bits do not contribute any information during classification. Reducing these irrelevant bit-wise operations results in significant energy savings without sacrificing accuracy. We tested the pruning of redundant bits on three applications: character recognition, hand-written digits recognition, and DNA sequencing classification problems.

It only updates the synaptic weights connected to the neuron that first generates a spike in a forward propagation step, which reduces the frequency of the synaptic weight updates significantly. The forward propagation process can be stopped once a neuron fires whether in the training mode or the inference mode, by which many unnecessary computations are just avoided and the latency in the inference mode is reduced.

However, the requirement of low-area, low-power and high adaptability to different patients challenge conventional algorithms and hardware platforms. In this design, a compact online learning neuromorphic hardware architecture with ultralow power consumption designed explicitly for biosignal processing is proposed. A trace-based Spiking-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) algorithm is applied to realize hardware-friendly online learning of a single-layer excitatory-inhibitory spiking neural network. Several techniques, including event-driven architecture and a fully optimized iterative computation approach, are adopted to minimize the hardware utilization and power consumption for the hardware implementation of online learning. Experiment results show that the proposed design reaches the accuracy of 87.36% and 83% for the Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology database (MNIST) and ECG classification. The hardware architecture is implemented on a Zynq-7020 FPGA.

In RC-Spike, synaptic currents are accumulated with resistively coupled synapses, with which circuit implementation can be simplified compared with CDC circuits. Because of this resistive coupling effect, a neuron in RC-Spike does not compute an exact dot product. However, RC-Spike can be successfully trained in the framework of SNNs, and we show that the learning performance of RC-Spike is as high as ANNs on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937662","NEC Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937662","spiking neural networks;in-memory computing;analog memory;neuromorcphic engineering","Couplings;Resistors;Computational modeling;Neurons;Artificial neural networks;Hardware;Energy efficiency","","1","","42","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To reduce the computational complexity, double-CRT representation has been adopted in the BGV-FHE cryptosystem, in which the 2nd-CRT, also known as the polynomial-CRT, can be viewed as performing Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Since the point size of the DFT is usually non power of two, the traditional Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm cannot be directly applied to reduce the complexity. This paper explores efficient VLSI architecture of Bluestein’s FFT for BGV-FHE applications. A mixed-radix single-port merged-bank memory addressing algorithm is presented to increase the effective memory bandwidth and to reduce the required memory area concurrently. The evaluation was conducted by implementing a Bluestein’s FFT compiler that can be configured to generate different point sizes of DFT designs for BGV-FHE.

In this work, we propose a synthesized RAW image-based end-to-end computer vision paradigm, taking the effect of ISP pipeline into account. In the proposed approach, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based tool is used to convert the fully processed color images to their corresponding RAW Bayer versions, generating the training data for end-to-end vision models. In the inference stage, RAW images from the sensor are directly fed to the end-to-end model, bypassing the entire ISP pipeline. Experimental results show that by training/tuning the CNN models using synthesized RAW images, it is possible to design an end-to-end (from RAW image to vision task) vision system that directly consumes RAW image data from the sensor with negligible vision performance degradation. By skipping the ISP pipeline, an image sensor can be directly integrated with the back-end vision processor without a complex image processor in the middle, making near-/in-sensor computing a practical approach.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937670","Shanghai Rising-Star Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937670","Near-sensor;in-sensor;Bayer pattern images;image signal processing (ISP);generative adversarial network(GAN);computer vision","Image sensors;Computer vision;Machine vision;Computational modeling;Pipelines;Training data;Signal processing","","3","","24","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Usually, the clinical diagnosis of patients is at a later stage, so early diagnosis can control the patient’s condition in time. The doctor is usually diagnosing the patient’s condition by 3D brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, because the 3D MRI structures of adjacent stages are almost similar, the multi-class diagnosis of AD becomes difficult. Therefore, there is a need to enhance the ability to extract more discriminative features from 3DMRI, promoting more accurate diagnosis. In addition, not only the entire MRI changes but also local areas in the MRI. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to changes in the entire image and local areas and to fuse features of different scales. In this paper, we propose an innovative convolutional network architecture for feature extraction and feature fusion. It consists of three modules: 1) a network based on ResNet-10, 2) 3D asymmetric convolution block (ACB), 3) multi-scale channel attentional feature fusion (MS-CAFF) module.

Actually, different pixels in an image usually have different contributions in results, which motivates us to apply region constraint in the image for adversarial perturbations generation. In this paper, we present an easy-to-implement way to decrease the unnecessary adversarial perturbations while preserving a relatively high attack success rate. Specifically, we do not use the same constraint of perturbations in the input image but set specific constraint for specific region. Furthermore, we point that adversarial examples work in a different way to normal images. Directly using the activated region in normal images is not optimal. Then, to get the crucial area in adversarial attacks, we propose six transformation schemes to revise the activated region which is generated by the normal image.

Thus, the Si area of each bit has a profound impact on the circuit. A method for extraction of multiple independent bits from single PUF cells is proposed. This method utilizes PUF preselection ‘tilt’ tests to obtain a new, uncorrelated, entropy source. During tilt tests, intentional controllable mismatch is introduced to the PUF cells, and their stability is concluded. The test could be revisited as a method to measure the internal mismatch size, by finding the tilt size required to flip the test result from ‘pass’ to ‘fail’. As the mismatch size is random and uncorrelated, it could be used to extract multiple additional PUF bits, as well as to find the unstable bit-cells relative to each new PUF bit. A Si implementation, which relies on the capacitive tilt PUF, in TSMC 65nm, is presented, with two additional bits. This demonstrates the applicability of the scheme for multiple new bits.

Recently, the wearable BS monitoring systems has made it possible to record the human BSs in the long term. However, BSs collected by long-term monitoring devices usually contain various types of noises, which significantly affect the detection accuracy on BS events of interest. To filter out the noises in the long-term BS recordings, a U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) based BS quality enhancement algorithm is proposed. The algorithm features a frequency-domain BS enhancement using U-Net to efficiently suppress the amplitude spectrum noises of BS segments. Experimental results on our BS dataset show that after enhancing with the proposed algorithm, the average SNR improvement of the sound segments is 28.72dB, which is the best among similar works. Moreover, after the enhancement, the accuracy of BS event detection using a threshold-based approach can reach 98.38%, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize the CNN for BS quality enhancement.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937685","bowel sounds;long-term monitoring;CNN;U-Net;amplitude spectrograms","Frequency-domain analysis;Filtering algorithms;Information filters;Gastrointestinal tract;Recording;Convolutional neural networks;Biomedical monitoring","","","","13","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the limitations of transmission bandwidth and computation resources of these systems pose heavy constraints on either the communication or direct processing of the large volume of physiological signals. Although signal compression can be adopted to compress the signals, most existing compression methods are computationally expensive and completely overlook the actual monitoring task purpose, which causes the discard of task-relevant information. Moreover, a complex reconstruction process is needed for further signal analysis at the cost of a heavy computational burden for downstream devices. We propose in this paper a novel flexible health monitoring framework where the signal is compressed with a low computation and hardware cost in-sensor compression matrix, trained in a task-aware fashion to preserve task-relevant information. The resulting compressed signals can be transmitted with significantly lower bandwidth, analyzed directly without a dedicated reconstruction process, or reconstructed with high fidelity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by showcasing a seizure monitoring system.

To monitor the heat phenomenon, the cost-efficient way is to allocate number-limited thermal sensors on the multicore system. Consequently, a lot of methods were proposed to find proper locations for thermal sensors allocation in the recent decade. However, due to the time-varying characteristic of the temperature behavior on the multi-core system, the temperature distribution usually changes along with time. Besides, the temperature distribution also depends on the target application on the multi-core system, which increases the difficulty to find the proper locations for the thermal sensor allocation. The improper locations for the thermal error while using the sensing information from the allocated error while using the sensing information from the allocated art, we propose an entropy-based thermal sensor allocation method, which aims to find locations to cover as many different temperature behaviors on the system as possible. In this way, we can apply the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) to reconstruct the full-chip temperature distribution efficiently based on the number-limited thermal sensing information.

As a result, agricultural communities have adopted leaf wetness sensors as a part of crop management systems to monitor the duration of leaf wetness resulting from dew, rainfall, or irrigation events. There are several commercially available electronic LWD sensors on the market. Although these systems are robust and highly precise, they are unable to fully mimic the surface properties and wettability of real leaves. As a result, accurately measuring LWD to estimate the risk of fungal disease is challenging. To mitigate the limitations of commercially available leaf wetness sensors (LWS) we have fabricated an interdigital capacitive sensor insulated with a bio-mimetic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface. Through a multi-step molding process, we were able to replicate the complex surface topography of leaves and integrate it into a capacitive wetness sensor. There was up to a 60% discrepancy in how long it takes for the LWS to reach full water surface saturation between leaf replica LWS and the commercial LWS, reflecting a more wettable leaf surface compared to that of the commercial sensor. These results verify the importance of incorporating leaf wettability in LWD measurement while also offering a simple fabrication method in producing a more accurate LWS.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937547","Leaf wetness duration;leaf wetness sensor;biomimetic;polydimethylsiloxane;leaf wettability","Pathogens;Plants (biology);Capacitive sensors;Sensor systems;Sensors;Surface topography;Biosensors","","","","13","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the current results of such tasks are not very satisfactory. Due to the lack of consideration of human body structure, unreal phenomena such as slippery feet and twisted joints will appear in the resulting movements. Since only a single correlation feature between music and dance is learned, there is a problem of poor matching between generated actions and music. To solve these problems, we propose a learning framework based on GAN and a multi-feature fusion strategy to realize the mapping from music to dance. We use two discriminators to constrain style and authenticity respectively to make our actions generated by the network more coherent and natural, which is essential in producing authentic dance sequences. Moreover, we extracted the three characteristics of music style, beat, and structure. Then we used the feature fusion method to obtain a comprehensive feature representation, which guarantees the consistency of the generated dance sequence with the input music to the greatest extent. The experimental quantitative and qualitative results show that our method can generate accurate, consistent, beat-matching dance movements from music. In addition, we also collected and produced a data set containing music features and corresponding pose sequences, which is convenient for pose generation based on music features.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937431","Music to dance;Multi-feature fusion;GAN","Training;Humanities;Correlation;Production;Generative adversarial networks;Feature extraction;Data models","","","","24","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among the proposed interface circuits for PEH, Synchronized Switch Harvesting on Capacitor (SSHC) rectifier distinguishes itself since it achieves high power efficiency while requires no inductor. The power SSHC can extract is a function of the voltage flip efficiency. In previous studies the flip efficiency is given only under particular condition, which limits the analysis and design of SSHC circuits. This paper presents the derivation of a generic flip efficiency expression. From the result, a novel capacitor-scaling design is proposed which can reduce the total switched capacitance by up to 50% while achieving the same performance (or to enhance performance while maintaining the total capacitance).

Energy harvesting technology, by which energy is extracted from the ambient environment, is developed for powering the ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices using different types of local energy, such as solar, vibration, and wind. In this paper, based on the vibration energy harvesting technology, we introduce a battery-free pavement roughness estimation system (BF-PRES), which provides road roughness information by linking the driving vibration and wireless packet count. Instead of harvesting energy to power an off-the-shelf commercial accelerometer and implementing some algorithms for vibration estimation, BF-PRES simply sends out a BLE Beacon packet, when the accumulated energy arrives at a sufficient level. Given that larger vibration intensity gives higher harvested power, the packet count within a constant time interval should be positively related to the road roughness. Lab testing shows the feasibility of the proposed design. In addition, this study also provides a new design scheme and easy implementation of battery-free or energy-constrained IoT systems.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937719","","Vibrations;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Transmitters;Roads;Estimation;Batteries","","1","","13","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, based on maximizing feature-BP correlation, most research attempts are focused on the R-peak of ECG and the characteristic points of the rising curve of the PPG. In this paper, to properly characterize the pulse transition, we study the T-wave of the ECG and the falling curve of the PPG to extract different reference points for PAT measurement. Such features hold significant information about the heart and the aorta, which are directly involved in blood flow and pressure. Consequently, these features can improve BP estimation significantly despite having a lower correlation with BP.

It is a typical supervised learning process, requiring loss function to supervise the training. No existing works directly calculate the loss between the reconstruction mesh and ground truth mesh. Instead, they indirectly used the Chamfer Distance (CD) between point clouds as the loss. Most of the previous works focus on the encoding and decoding parts instead of the loss and CD is used for all works. However, when CD is applied to two point clouds with the same number of points, some points can match any number of points in another point cloud, so some points will be less involved in calculating the loss function, which will reduce the utilization of information. Therefore, We propose a new point matching strategy to calculate the loss. The point matching strategy we proposed limits the maximum number of matches for each point, allowing more points to be more involved in the loss calculation, thereby improving the information utilization rate.

It is known that one should use the frequency-dependent gain when applying the Miller theorem to get the exact results. But, what is sometimes overlooked is that applying the theorem is non-trivial when dealing with a voltage-controlled current source (VCCS). This is because the voltage gain of the VCCS also depends on the feedback impedance. Instead of computing this voltage gain, we do a source transformation, making it amenable for a straightforward application of the Miller theorem in a two-stage Miller opamp. We also derive an equivalent RC model for the impedance at the input and output and give a qualitative explanation for the same. This gives a different perspective to understand the pole-zero positions, and also brings out the “hidden state” (unobservable/uncontrollable state, as known in control theory) present in a two-stage Miller opamp.

This leads to large area and energy overhead as well as low RRAM area utilization. Hence, compact RRAM-based CIM with simple pulse-based programming scheme is thus more desirable. To achieve this, we propose a chip-in-the-loop training approach to compensate for the network performance drop due to the stochastic behavior of the RRAM cells.

In this paper, we design an end-to-end Inpainting Network for Incomplete Text (INIT), which can reconstruct each incomplete character into complete character. INIT can separate the text from the background and just reconstruct the text regions, which reduces the influence caused by the background. And INIT is supervised by reconstruction loss and semantic loss to reach the most likely text.

On SITD, the recognition accuracy can achieve 82.99% by the existing text recognition method with the help of INIT, while the accuracy is only 61.99% by the same recognition method with the conventional image inpainting method.

This design includes a temperature-dependent bias voltage generation circuit with different slopes over temperature which can be varied with a step size of nearly 8mV and an additional DC voltage calibration circuit to generate differential bias voltages independently in I and Q channels. The temperature slope of the bias voltage being generated is dependent on the NMOS width and the current flowing through the NMOS.

IMPLY logic is the first stateful logic proposed for memristive IMC. Approximate computing in memory, particularly using memristive stateful logic, has not been explored yet. In this paper, we combine these two concepts and propose a novel algorithm for serial IMPLY-based adders to implement an approximate full-adder. The proposed approximate full-adder was assessed in an image processing application, and image quality metrics like Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) were calculated. In addition, different error quality metrics like Error Distance (ED) and Mean ED (MED) were assessed. Our study shows that the proposed method can achieve up to 40% improvement whereas maintaining the introduced error in an acceptable range (i.e., a PSNR above 32.4).","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937475","Full-adder;Approximate Computing;IMPLY;Processing In-Memory;Image Processing","Measurement;PSNR;Image processing;Approximate computing;Memristors;Memory;Approximation algorithms","","13","","40","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal super-resolution (STSR) network which is jointly trained for the video captioning task and the video super-resolution task in an end-to-end fashion. Specifically, a video super-resolution task consists of two subtasks: spatial super-resolution restores high-resolution image features while temporal super-resolution reconstructs missing frame features between two adjacent sampled frames. By sharing multi-modal encoders across both of these two tasks, STSR encourages encoders to capture salient visual contents and learn context-aware representations.

In this paper, a real-time image inpainting system using PatchMatch based two-generator adversarial network (PatchMatch-GAN), is proposed to improve the clarity of generated images. The first generator is committed to continuous semantic textures, and the second one focuses on the image sharpness. Parallel-dilated convolution is used to enlarge the receptive field of filters. For the first generator, a pre-trained VGG16 is used as an encoder to extract features. For the second generator, a DCGAN-like network is designed to generate images. And a feature replacement method is utilized to improve the resolution. The edge loss has also been proposed as a part of the loss function to emphasize the role of the shape of objects. Experiments are carried out on place2 and irregular mask datasets.

A feasible solution to this problem can be implemented on CNN by introducing a quantization step (Qstep) into the CNN. As the quantization noise changes, the CNN filter’s ability to suppress noise changes accordingly. The (vanilla) convolution layer can be replaced directly by this method in existing CNN filters.

A hybrid-precision-signed-weight ITIR (HPSWITIR) sub-array realizes the signed-weight by constant-term resistor circuit without additional ReRAM array overhead. 2. A computing array reduces the IR-drop and transistor errors of the array by assembling a series of HPSW-1T1R sub-arrays and achieve high-density array integration. 3. Global-share ADCs (GS-ADCs) optimize the analog signals conversion process to improve computing parallelism. 4. Odd-Channel-Input-WeightInverse Coding (ORIWI) can further reduce IR drop by decreasing the accumulative SL current (ISL) inside the HPSWITIR sub-array. In these manners, this work constructed a high computing-density HPSW-CIM calculation core for fully parallel MAC operation. The circuit-level evaluation shows that the energy cost of data conversion reduced by 2×-2.7×, reduces the peak column average current by 3.1×-6.2×, and improves array computing density by at least twice. The system-level evaluation shows that, in an HPSW-CIM core with 256KB memory in the 28nm process, the peak energy efficiency reaches 95.8TOPS/W@8bIN-4bW-8bO.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937828","Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937828","ReRAM;computing-in-memory;MAC;analog computing;Edge device","Resistors;Array signal processing;Nonvolatile memory;Microprocessors;Memory management;Parallel processing;Transistors","","4","","13","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the performance and accuracy of current computation are limited by large read currents of RRAM cells and their variations. This work presents a novel RRAM-based charge-domain design, C-RRAM, to resolve these limitations. A 3TlRlC cell is proposed to execute MAC operations by capacitor discharging. The resistance variations can be tolerated with reasonable discharging time, which is accelerated by a positive feedback loop. Also, the output from each cell is accumulated by charge sharing instead of summing currents to eliminate the static current path in readout circuits. In this way, robust and efficient RRAM-based CIM operation is enabled with fully input parallelism. A $512\times 514$ RRAM array is implemented to evaluate the benefits of the proposed charge-domain approach. The experiment results show that C-RRAM can suppress the output variations by $41\times$ and incur negligible accuracy loss for ResNet-18 on Cifar10 dataset.

Until now, there has been no comparison of organic and oxide FE-based metal-FE-metal (MFM) devices in harnessing the TNC effect. As a result, we introduce an external resistor-MFM(R-MFM) series circuit to investigate the role of organic and oxide FEs in harnessing the TNC effect at low supply voltages. The multidomain Ginzburg-Landau-Khalatnikov theory is used to model the FE materials in a technology computer-aided design environment. We show that: (i) organic FE-based R-MFM series circuit can harness the TNC effect at just 1 V whereas an oxide FE-based R-MFM series circuit cannot; (ii) the coercivity of an organic FE is 77.39% lower than its counterpart, oxide FE; (iii) the remanent polarization of an organic MFM (1.2$\mu$C/cm2) is very close to the channel charge density of a CMOS transistor (1.6$\mu$C/cm2) making it helpful in addressing capacitance matching issues in NC transistor; (iv) an organic FE-based R-MFM series circuit dissipates 78.89% less energy than an oxide FE-based R-MFM series circuit; (v) the TNC effect and time are justified by its dependence on R. Finally, this article suggests that an organic FE-based MFM could be used as a gate stack of any transistor to achieve sub-60 mV/decade switching energy, making it ideal for ultra-low voltage NC transistors.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937975","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937975","Ferroelectric (FE);hafnium oxide;multidomain;negative capacitance (NC);organic ferroelectric;TCAD","Low voltage;Design automation;Logic gates;Capacitance;Iron;Transistors;Transient analysis","","","","17","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This error equation is formulated in terms of generalized HBP, where the odd values are equated to zero and the filter coefficients are constrained with complete dyadic conditions. This produces a generalized design for bi-orthogonal filter with perfect reconstruction. Furthermore, in order to realize power-efficient designs, we propose a reversible logic based implementation for the proposed bi-orthogonal wavelet filter bank.

However, this scheme fails to consider the joint effect of multiple LACs whose induced errors may counteract with each other when applied simultaneously. In this work, we propose a method to select multiple LAC candidates in a single round under a given bound on maximum error distance (MaxED). It first builds a miter by adding a multiplexer into the network for each LAC candidate in the network. Then, a quantified satisfiability problem is formulated on the miter and solved to obtain a maximal set of LACs that can be applied simultaneously. The experimental results show that under the normalized MaxED bound of 1%, our method reduces the circuit area by up to 39%, which is 20% higher than the area reduction achieved by a baseline method that iteratively selects one single LAC per round.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937529","approximate computing;approximate logic synthesis;satisfiability;quantified satisfiability;maximum error distance","Multiplexing;Circuits and systems;Scalability;Approximate computing;Circuit synthesis","","2","","26","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hotspots are those patterns that may cause fatal defects in the final tape-out, such as short or open circuits. Therefore, identifying and eliminating hotspots in the early design stage can improve chip yield and reduce manufacturing costs. Traditionally, lithography simulation is used to detect hotspot patterns. But as the feature size shrinks and the design complexity increases, the lithography simulation of the entire chip requires a longer time overhead, which seriously delays the design cycle. Consequently, many deep learning-based methods have been proposed to accelerate hotspot detection. These approaches all show a good performance in the ICCAD 2012 contest benchmarks. However, deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose to generate samples by adjusting the critical distance between polygons in the layout based on existing patterns. Layouts are very sensitive to the distance between polygons, the type of a layout may flip by slight modifications in the distances. These adversarial samples are closer to the decision boundary of neural networks than the original ones. Experimental results show that the accuracy of neural network-based hotspot detectors drops significantly in the dataset formed by generated samples. Adding the generated samples to the training dataset improves the robustness and generalization ability of neural networks.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937434","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937434","","Training;Learning systems;Simulation;Perturbation methods;Lithography;Layout;Neural networks","","","","12","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The line/load regulation rate is respectively $12.4 \mu \mathrm{V} / \mathrm{V}$ and $1.04 \mathrm{mV} / \mathbf{A}$. Implemented in a $0.25 \mu \mathrm{m}$ BCD process, the proposed IOR2 PWM regulator is capable of converting input voltage of 5 V to 65 V to output range of 3.3 V to 60 V with adjustable switching frequency up to 2.2 MHz, showing a peak efficiency of 94.5% at 1 A load current.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937516","adaptive ramp;load transition response;line/load regulation rate;voltage mode control","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Regulators;Circuits and systems;Switching frequency;Pulse width modulation;Converters","","","","12","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"LDO Regulator Optimized on Power Efficiency and Load Transient Response with Voltage Damper and Body Loop Feedback","H. Kim; S. S. Kwak; Y. S. Kim",NA; NA; NA,2022 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS),"11 Nov 2022","2022","","","3571","3574","This paper presents the design of low-dropout (LDO) regulator optimized on power efficiency and load transient response. As the LDO is always-on block, the quiescent current is a critical parameter of LDO. The proposed circuit includes an op-amp which shows high slew rate with low quiescent current. A voltage damper circuit is included for fast load transient response. A body feedback loop helps the LDO regulator to react to relatively slow distortion of the output voltage. The proposed LDO regulator is fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS process. The test results show that maximum undershoot is 125.9 mV during load transient and 0.177 ns/$\mu$ m figure-of-merit (FOM) at the quiescent current of 0.02532 mA.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937778","National Research Foundation; Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937778","LDO regulator;fast load transient;power efficiency;voltage damper;body feedback loop;quiescent current","Transient response;Feedback loop;Regulators;Circuits and systems;Distortion;CMOS process;Shock absorbers","","6","","8","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It converts a 2.8V to 4.8V Li-ion battery voltage to three regulated output voltages: 1.2 V, 1.8V, and 3.3V for different back-end circuits, such as digital circuits and analog circuits. The converter operates at discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and regulates the output using pulse-skip modulation (PSM) to reduce cross-regulation. Furthermore, the converter includes an adaptive on-time (AOT) generator to improve the output power range at low input voltage and control the maximum output voltage ripple under different inputs. Furthermore, three self-tracking zero current detectors (ST-ZCD) provide appropriate off-time periods for power MOSFETs to reduce the reverse inductor current. The measurement results show that the proposed SITO buck-boost converter achieves a maximum peak power conversion efficiency of 75.8% under 315mW output power. In addition, the peak inductor current is well controlled under different input voltages.","2158-1525","978-1-6654-8485-5","10.1109/ISCAS48785.2022.9937353","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9937353","single-inductor triple-output (SITO);DC-DC;adaptive on-time generator (AOT);zero current detector (ZCD)","MOSFET;Power measurement;Wearable computers;Modulation;Detectors;Generators;Power conversion","","1","","10","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
