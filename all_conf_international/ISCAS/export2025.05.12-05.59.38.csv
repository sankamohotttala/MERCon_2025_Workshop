This allows modification of the spectral response of the HKS filter, enabling a flatter passband and a steeper transient band through adjustments to the value of positive integer p. Subsequently, two methods are presented to implement the generalized HKS filter.

Their ability to perform logic operations using RRAM devices makes them a critical component in non-von Neumann processing-in-memory architectures. Passive RRAM crossbar arrays (1-RRAM or 1R), however, suffer from a major issue of sneak path currents, leading to a lower readout margin and increasing write failures. To address this challenge, active RRAM arrays have been proposed, which incorporate a selector device in each memory cell (termed 1-selector-1-RRAM or 1S1R). The selector eliminates currents from unselected cells and therefore effectively mitigates the sneak path phenomenon. Yet, there is a need for a comprehensive analysis of 1S1R arrays, particularly concerning in-memory computation. In this paper, we introduce a 1S1R model tailored to a VO2-based selector and TiN/TiOx/HfOx/Pt RRAM device. We also present simulations of 1S1R arrays, incorporating all parasitic parameters, across a range of array sizes from 4 × 4 to 512 × 512.

This paper presents an obfuscation approach for locking of such FSM networks at the behavioral level of abstraction. The proposed technique is built on the encryption of both the state and the transition encoding, each with its unique key, known only to the IP provider. A steganography approach is used on top, to ensure that the message containing the secret key for unlocking does not capture the attacker’s attention as target for inspection. The FSM-based NN works as intended only if the proper key is entered at runtime; otherwise, it will perform erroneous classification.

Consequently, the design of matrix multiplication units within GPGPUs and ensuring their utilization have become key issues in optimizing AI workloads. This paper explores an incremental design approach, building upon a Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT) GPGPU architecture, to facilitate General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) acceleration.

Almost all existing spike ripples detection concentrates in the high frequency band (80-500Hz) without considering its co-occurrence spikes in low frequency band (1-70Hz). In this paper, a novel EEG-based spike ripples detection algorithm combining both low and high frequency is proposed. For the low frequency band, the energy histogram is derived by the nonlinear energy operator (NLEO). When the average energy exceeds a pre-set threshold, the average duration of the monotonically decreasing segment (ADDS) and the signal filtered by smooth nonlinear energy operator (SNEO) are further calculated. The enhanced K-means algorithm is used for candidate spikes selection. For the high frequency band, the peak distribution is generated to select high frequency oscillations (HFOs). Then, 21 significant features are extracted from HFOs and a quadratic kernel support vector machine (SVM) is trained for candidate ripples selection. If both the candidate ripple and spike are in the same frame, it is considered as a spike ripple. Finally, feature selection based on Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) is studied to enhance overall performance. The proposed algorithm is compared with two related methods on EEGs of 6 subjects, which can achieve a convincing performance with an average of 91.35% precision, 93.88% recall, 92.56% F1 score, and 96.62% BA, respectively.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558280","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558280","","Support vector machines;Histograms;Epilepsy;Filtering algorithms;Feature extraction;Hafnium oxide;Electroencephalography","","","","20","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the energy consumption of electrocardiogram (ECG) processing in ANN has become one of the most critical factors. One solution is using a spiking neural network (SNN), effectively reducing power consumption and improving energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the inevitable membrane potential storage and accumulation of SNN result in significant energy and area overheads. This paper proposes a time domain (TD) based SNN processor for ECG classification. We propose a novel memory delay unit (MDU), part of the memory delay line (MDL), to store and accumulate membrane potential. With this method, power consumption can be significantly reduced.

However, the wireless capsule detector used for diagnosis is constrained by the camera’s low resolution and limited computing resources, making it difficult to deploy computation- and memory access-intensive SR models. In this paper, we propose an efficient universal SR accelerator based on lookup tables, namely USR-LUT, which can support various SR algorithms. We design a LUT-based computing unit (LCU) with higher efficiency and lower area overhead. By utilizing the sparsity of deconvolution, we propose an efficient data mapping scheme that can flexibly support convolution and deconvolution with different kernel sizes, achieving a 3.24× acceleration for deconvolution. Tile-based computing is adopted to reduce memory resources and external memory access (EMA) overhead. Through experimental evaluation, compared with LUT-based SR algorithms, the USR-LUT achieves the least LUT storage entries of 82k and the smallest LUT resource overhead of 0.078MB, respectively. The USR-LUT achieves the highest area efficiency of 175.7GOPS/mm2 and throughput area ratio (TAR) of 39.9fps/mm2 under the 8-bit precision compared with the state-of-the-art works.

This is because the HDR image generated from an original SDR image may have changes in color. Some color changes can give people a comfortable impression, but this may also change the information originally expressed in the SDR image. Therefore, this paper researches the CD of the original SDR image and the generated HDR image, and proposes a network to predict the CDs of SDR and HDR image pairs. Specifically, we first build a SDR-HDR image CD dataset. The dataset contains 504 SDR and HDR image pairs, where HDR images are generated from the SDR images using five HDR image generation methods.

The TDS method uses cubic spline interpolation for sampling the signal as well as signal reconstruction. As compared to other non-uniform sampling techniques, TDS offers an improved accuracy of the reconstructed signal and/or a reduction in the number of retained samples which enhances the compression factor (CF). Such improvements will also lead to an enhanced power efficiency in ECG monitoring systems. Users can control the associated reconstruction error by adjusting the maximum number of samples that can be disregarded (N) and/or the magnitude of the fourth derivative of the signal. The presented results demonstrate that the proposed method can offer up to 20% improvement in the CF as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques reported in the literature without compromising the reconstruction error. Alternatively, it can offer up to 53% enhancement in the accuracy of the reconstructed signal for a given CF.

The AFE circuit makes use of two voltage buffers operated in a ping-pong configuration to ensure a continuous time operation. Measurement results reveal that, when autozeroing each 100μs, the AFE input impedance reaches 250MΩ at 50Hz, which is about 6x larger compared to the current state-of-the-art in large-area electronics. The Signal-to-Noise ratio estimated for non-contact electrodes with a 200MΩ series impedance remains above 20dB, while achieving a bandwidth of 1kHz, a power consumption of 0.22mW and an area per channel of 2.94mm2.

Current advanced estimators designed for nonuniform noise are computationally expensive and often unable to yield satisfactory performance in unfavorable conditions, such as low signal-to-noise ratio, small number of snapshots, and sources with different transmit power. To address this, this paper proposes a new method to estimate the number of sources under nonuniform noise. The proposed method first constructs a likelihood ratio statistic as a function of the maximum likelihood estimation of the array covariance matrix, which is estimated by a subspace estimation algorithm. Then, based on the asymptotic theory of the likelihood ratio, the number of sources is estimated via a sequence of hypothesis tests. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed estimator is consistent in the general asymptotic regime. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator achieves a higher correct detection probability in unfavorable conditions and is more robust against nonuniformity of noise than state-of-the-art estimators.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558530","Array signal processing;source number estimation;nonuniform noise;likelihood ratio test","Maximum likelihood estimation;Simulation;Noise;Signal processing algorithms;White noise;Probability;Parallel processing","","1","","19","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This methodology uses divergent delay path selection based on intermediary error behaviour to improve the PUF uniqueness vs. an unmodified datapath, even when only moderate voltage scaling is applied. To verify the effectiveness of this method, a pipelined fast fourier transform (FFT) butterfly architecture is implemented at 45nm technology node, and a voltage over scaling technique is applied to extract PUF bits.

To address this issue, we propose an optimization for time-division multiplexing(TDM). This optimization combines the advantages of traditional logic multiplexer circuits and high-speed serial circuits by utilizing the serial-to-parallel converter (ISERDES) and parallel-to-serial converter (OSERDES). The I/OSERDES approach typically employs the low-voltage differential signaling standard (LVDS) for high-speed data transmission, necessitating two physical pins. To save one physical pin, we advocate for a single-ended transmission solution without a forward clock. Moreover, we propose a new algorithm at the receiver to align the phase of the receiver’s clock.

As a result, it requires large-scale cluster computing resources to train such models. However, large-scale computing clusters tend to experience frequent failures during runtime, so fault-tolerance mechanisms such as checkpointing and restart are widely used in model training. Traditional checkpointing techniques periodically save all parameters of model, resulting in significant overhead. To address this issue, we propose an improved partial checkpointing mechanism for recommendation models named SSDC. SSDC uses an adaptive threshold strategy to reduce expensive operations when saving checkpoints, thereby having good scalability. Furthermore, SSDC saves the differential value of the model parameters, making it feasible to sparsify the otherwise dense embedding tables, thus reducing the bandwidth and time overhead to reconstruct checkpoints. Our evaluations show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, SSDC greatly reduces the time overhead of saving and reconstructing checkpoints, while achieving comparable training accuracy.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10557880","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10557880","Recommendation System Models;Fault Tolerance;Partial Checkpointing","Checkpointing;Training;Adaptation models;Fault tolerance;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Scalability","","1","","22","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, digital adversarial examples are typically applied to pre-captured static images. The perturbations are generated by loss optimization with knowledge of target model hyperparameters and are added offline. Physical adversarial examples, on the other hand, tamper with the physical target or use a realistically fabricated target to fool the DNN. A sufficient number of pristine target samples captured under different varying environmental conditions are required to create the physical adversarial perturbations. Both digital and physical input evasion attacks are not robust against dynamic object-scene variations and the adversarial effects are often weak-ened by model reduction and quantization when the DNNs are implemented on edge artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator platforms. This demonstration presents a practical man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on an edge DNN first reported in [1].

Near-data processing (NDP) could alleviate data traffic and energy consumption, but the storage demand of LLM is still enormous. Weight sparsity is helpful for reducing data capacity. Unstructured sparsity sacrifices less accuracy compared to structured one, but the random non-zero values distribution in NDP leads to load imbalance among parallel processing units. Here we propose LauWS which is seamlessly combined into various prior arts of sparsity.

In the current design, however, the probability initialization for both fine-and coarse-grained contexts does not follow the principle of entropy continuation. Moreover, the mapping process to produce coarse-grained contexts is a combination of several fine-grained contexts, leading to an unstable update of probability for coarse-grained contexts, which affects the accuracy of the fine-grained context model in probability estimation.To address the underlying problems, we propose two approaches to improve OBUF: initializing the probabilities for fine-grained and coarse-grained contexts according to entropy continuation and setting the probability update upper and lower bounds for coarse-grained contexts adaptively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique is more consistent with the underlying principles of OBUF and significantly improves the performance of both octree-based and Trisoup-based geometry coding.

However, in the case of straightforward images with limited high-complexity information, a low number of iterations already yields satisfactory quality. Extending the iteration stages does not notably enhance the quality but results in increased reconstruction time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive stage activated unfolding network (ASAUN-CS), mainly including a measurement assessment module in the compressed domain and a stage selection module in the feature domain.

By considering the difference, we proposed a Multi-scale Attentive Fusion Network (MAF-Net) to adaptively capture and describe the object change with a wide range of scales. The MAF-Net first extracts multi-scale visual features of bitemporal images from different stages of the CNN backbone, then captures the changes in each pair of the features with the proposed Multi-scale Change Aware Encoders (MCAE). Specifically, the MCAE captures the change-aware discriminative information over the paired multi-scale bitemporal features by Transformer-based different and content cross-attention encoding. Furthermore, a Gated Attentive Fusion (GAF) module is introduced to adaptively aggregate the relevant change-aware features to enhance the change caption performance.

These approaches often require real-time evaluation, sometimes even with specialized hardware architecture for mixed precision. Evaluating inputs with all FFN parameters may also result in significant additional overhead in practical applications. Inspired by the observation of sparse activation in FFNs, we introduce a method called DP-FFN, which can split FFN into several functional partitions, and the computing of FFN is based on these partitions. DP-FFN is a two-stage computation approach: the first is to construct functional partitions by grouping frequently activated neurons, and the second is to conduct fine-grained computations using activated functional partitions to maintain model performance. Experimental results show that DP-FFN achieves 1.71X speedup over a baseline with about 2% accuracy loss while using only 20% of FFN parameters.

The absolute concentration of odour plumes carries little meaning and these plumes are only encountered in an intermittent, transient fashion. However, navigation algorithms that are driven by odour encounter events, can successfully find odour sources by extracting spatiotemporal information. The event driven nature of odour plumes motivates a fully event-driven sensing and processing pipeline for robot navigation. Hence, we developed a spiking neural network, implemented on neuromorphic hardware, that can successfully decode odour-puff direction from a pair of enose-systems.

The ability to support both inference and training on a single macro is desired for AI edge devices, while most existing SRAM-based CIM macros only support inference. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient and ADC-free transpose CIM (AFT-CIM) macro that can support both inference and training on a single macro. First, we introduce a computational circuit with switchable row or column inputs, which not only maintains input flexibility but also simplifies the circuits. Furthermore, we propose an orthogonal path adder tree (OPAT) that achieves flexible switching between two computation paths: row-wise accumulation and column-wise accumulation. The different combinations of input and accumulation directions enable different data computation paths on the proposed AFT-CIM macro. Different computations required in DNN training, such as matrix multiplication or transpose matrix multiplication, can be realized by flexibly controlling the data flow of the AFT-CIM macro. A 32Kb SRAM CIM macro is designed using 28 nm CMOS technology. The circuit-level evaluation shows that the power consumption of the OPAT circuit is reduced by 1.7× and the area overhead is reduced by 1.3× compared to the design using two separate adder trees. The peak energy efficiency of the CIM macro reaches 62.9 TOPS/W. Compared to SOTA transpose CIM macros, AFT-CIM shows 2.3× to 3.9× energy efficiency.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558546","Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558546","Computing-in-memory;Transpose;ADC-free;Online training;SRAM;Forward;Backward","Training;Random access memory;Switches;In-memory computing;Energy efficiency;Common Information Model (computing);Artificial intelligence","","1","","11","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead of training multiple models corresponding to different tasks, we only need to train a single model with shared parameters by using multi-task learning. Multi-task learning highly reduces the number of parameters in the machine learning models and thus reduces the computational and storage requirements. When we apply multi-task learning on deep neural networks (DNNs), we need to further compress the model since the model size of a single DNN is still a critical challenge to many computation systems, especially for edge platforms. However, when model compression is applied to multi-task learning, it is challenging to maintain the performance of all the different tasks. To deal with this challenge, we propose a min-max optimization framework for the training of highly compressed multi-task DNN models.

The first strategy (CL-M) involves masking the entire information of one modality while keeping the other three modalities unchanged to construct negative samples, which can keep awareness towards each single modality, reduce the excessive dependence on a single modality and improve the model’s robustness. The second strategy (CL-R) replaces a modality in a sample with the same modality from another sample, thereby constructing a negative sample. CL-R is designed to distinguish and comprehend the differences and relationships among modalities when faced with new data integration, which can enhance the model’s generalization ability. Additionally, we further advance masking entity nouns corresponding to objects in the video, not only to compel the model to draw stronger associations between textual cues and visual representations, but also to reduce the hallucination often existed in textual outputs, generating the answers closely related to video contents.

As we move farther from the source, the intensity of radio waves diminishes according to an inverse square law. Implementing an internal feedback body biasing connection using flipped-well transistors can dynamically enhance the rectifier’s conductivity and eliminate the need for external circuitry. In this work, we propose a novel feedback self-adaptive body biasing rectifier for RF energy harvesting for the UHF band (902-928 MHz). Based on 22nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) technology, this rectifier achieves the high sensitivity required to harvest weak signals at far distances and a competitive power conversion efficiency (PCE). Furthermore, we introduce a methodology for designing and optimizing a differential impedance matching network (IMN) and rectifier. Based on the simulation results, our proposed 5-stage rectifier exhibits a high sensitivity of -31.4dBm at 1V under a capacitive load, surpassing comparable results achieved by previous works. A good peak PCE of 31.3% under a 5MΩ load at the typical corner makes our rectifier an ideal choice for ultra-low power RF energy harvesting applications.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558291","Virginia Microelectronics Consortium; Semiconductor Research Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558291","RF energy harvesting;High sensitivity;22nm-FDSOI;Body biasing;Differential impedance matching","Radio frequency;Sensitivity;Impedance matching;RF signals;Rectifiers;Silicon-on-insulator;Transistors","","3","","24","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In stark contrast to conventional model-based control methods, the DPG-RL leverages artificial intelligence (AI) technology, rendering it model-free and capable of dynamically seeking the optimal control policy to enhance HAPF performance.

In respond to this threat, defence mechanisms have been presented to obfuscate the DNN execution, making it difficult to infer the correlation between side-channel information and DNN architecture. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNN obfuscation is time-consuming, requires expert-level changes in existing DNN compilers (e.g., Tensor Virtual Machine (TVM)), and often relies on prior knowledge of the attack models. In this work, we study the impact of various obfuscation levels on the defence effectiveness, and present a streamlined DNN obfuscation process that is extremely fast and is agnostic to any attack models. Our study reveals that by just modifying the scheduling of DNN operations on the GPU, we can achieve comparable defense performance as the SOTA in an attack agnostic manner. We also propose a simple algorithm that determines an effective scheduling configuration for mitigating DNN model stealing at a fraction of a time required by SOTA obfuscation methods.

Existing works lack specific optimizations for DNN dataflows, thereby yielding suboptimal multicast efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose MEIN, a Multicast-Efficient Interconnect Network for multi-chiplet DNN accelerators. Firstly, we introduce a highly efficient routing algorithm tailored for DNN dataflows. It optimizes the multicast tree structure to reduce path latency, while also improving the path selection mechanism to minimize link contention. Secondly, we propose a lightweight router microarchitecture that enhances the hardware resource utilization by simplifying multicast ports.

However, the presence of stimulation artifact (SA) makes it a significant challenge in implementing such a closed-loop system which requires concurrent recording of neural signals and stimulation of certain brain regions. High dynamic range (DR) is an important requirement for neural amplifiers to ensure lossless recording. We propose a high DR, rail-to-rail artifact tolerant system-on-a-chip (SoC). In the absence of SA, the SoC records and quantifies neural signals with low power consumption. When a stimulation artifact is detected, an additional ADC and a DAC are used to sample and reconstruct the artifact signal, respectively. The reconstructed artifact is then fed to the input of a differential amplifier as a common-mode signal for artifact removal. The target neural signal can subsequently be extracted by an independent component analysis algorithm. The technique has been verified using X-Fab’s 0.18-µm CMOS process. The simulation result suggests the power consumptions with and without artifact suppression are 15.6 and 46.5 µW, respectively.

This paper proposes new evaluation metrics that assess the alignment between input text and generated images for every individual object. Firstly, according to the input text, chatGPT is utilized to produce questions for the generated images. After that, we use Visual Question Answering(VQA) to measure the relevance of the generated images to the input text, which allows for a more detailed evaluation of the alignment compared to existing methods. In addition, we use Non-Reference Image Quality Assessment(NR-IQA) to evaluate not only the text-image alignment but also the quality of the generated images.

In this work, we proposed a two-step approach for higher-order dynamics prediction without network topology. First, the observations of nodal dynamics of a specific dynamical model on unknown hypergraphs are collected to solve an optimization problem by Ridge regression, to obtain a surrogate incidence matrix. Second, the prediction is obtained by iterating the equation of the dynamical model with the surrogate incidence matrix. We define the average relative prediction error to evaluate the performance of our prediction method, and a wide range of hypergraph dynamics with different parameters are predicted.

We found that using a Chebyshev type-II band-pass filter with cutoff frequencies of 0.35 Hz for high pass and 10 Hz for low pass performs best across six measured Signal Quality Indices (SQIs), achieving a 12% improvement in the dynamic time-warping (DTW) SQI. Furthermore, using a modified Savitzky-Golay smoothing algorithm with a frequency domain-derived window parameter leads to additional improvements in SQI-derived features of 14.09% and 12.22% in DTW and skewness respectively. Our proposed approach provides a universal solution for processing high-frequency raw PPG recordings and prepares them for the extraction of morphological features.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558515","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558515","","Band-pass filters;Smoothing methods;Filtering;Noise;Optical variables measurement;Chebyshev approximation;Photoplethysmography","","","","22","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, inspired by the viewing process of PI, we first generate multiple viewport sequences according to the real viewing trajectory and then extract multilevel features with a pre-trained backbone.

However, the homogeneous diffuse assumption in estimating receive sensor weights in DASB is violated for specular reflectors like bones or needles in guided interventions which generate highly directive reflections challenging their visualization in the US images. To address this, apodization coefficients need to be dynamically determined according to reflection directivity. This work introduces a novel approach called raster apodization design (RAD) to dynamically adjust apodization coefficients at the pixel level on hardware, taking into account the directivity of reflections. RAD allows for the simultaneous estimation of apodization coefficients for all pixels at a fixed depth, resembling a raster scan while reusing a single apodization window. The design is implemented on a Xilinx XCZ7010clg400-1 FPGA and compares resource and power estimates at pixel level and for a region of interest.

However, intensive computation requirements with respect to the token size hinder ViT from being deployed on edge devices with diverse computation resources. Recently, token pruning has been proven to be a promising method to exploit the redundancy of tokens. However, it often requires a laborious retraining process to meet different resource constraints. In this paper, we introduce Fisher information (FI) from tokens to evaluate token importance across different transformer blocks and propose a Retraining-free Constraint-aware Token Pruning (RCTP) framework. RCTP employs a two-step process to obtain the optimal pruning thresholds without retraining under different FLOPs constraints. In the first step, a candidate threshold table and a FLOPs-Fisher table are constructed through a three-stage pipeline to record the trade-off between FLOPs and FI loss of each candidate threshold. In the second step, a modified Viterbi algorithm determines optimal threshold sets with minimum overall FI loss under different FLOPs-constraints in one shot. Our experiment illustrates that RCTP attains better accuracy-FLOPs trade-off than prior pruning-based approaches.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558603","National Science and Technology Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558603","Vision Transformer;edge computing;token pruning;image classification","Computer vision;Viterbi algorithm;Circuits and systems;Machine vision;Image edge detection;Pipelines;Termination of employment","","","","10","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, various portable devices are capable of receiving a large amount of radio and real-time spectrum data, leading to a growing demand for fast and lightweight modulation recognition solutions. However, most existing AMR schemes emphasize higher recognition accuracy without considering complexity and model size. Therefore, lightweight methods meeting the accuracy requirements are still left to be investigated. In this paper, we propose an efficient AMR model that utilizes a liquid state machine (LSM), a typical spiking neural network (SNN), for the first time. This model is faster and more lightweight than previous solutions, and it utilizes a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier and a normalization unit to enhance performance, achieving a recognition accuracy of 96.4%.

First, the location of each character is initialized by coarsely locating the text instance and predicting the length, which provides effective guidance for the subsequent position-sensitive decoder. It is worth noting that the model requires only word-level supervision to achieve decent performance in the absence of expensive character-level annotations. Second, we design a mask prediction strategy based on the length information that masks character information at the feature level, and guides the model to predict the missing part. It empowers the decoder with language modeling capability without introducing extra modules. Additionally, considering the coordination between each module, a multi-stage training strategy is proposed to optimize the convergence process. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that LATextSpotter achieves the optimal end-to-end performance on arbitrary-shaped benchmarks by 76.6% and competitive spotting performance on multi-oriented datasets.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558151","Nature; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558151","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Training;Annotations;Text recognition;Text detection;Predictive models;Linguistics;Transformers","","","","35","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As semiconductor technology advances, on-grid pin access becomes a distant goal due to increasing discrepancy between contacted polysilicon pitch (CPP) and M1 pitch (M1P). Though the multiple-layout approach to this problem was proposed for some specific case, no investigation into its impact on chip-level routing is found. In this paper, we generalize the multiple-layout approach. We design a 7.5-track standard cell library for the case of the ratio CPP/MIP = 3/2 to study the impact of the multiple-layout approach on chip-level routing. The experiments for this specific case show that the multiple-layout approach can achieve not only on-grid pin accesses but also 46% to 83% fewer DRC violations with 28% to 50% less runtime at the expense of 5% to 13% increase in the longest path delay.

In literature for moderate-resolution CTDSMs, traditional loop filters are implemented with either fully passive, active, or hybrid integrators. These designs have a tight tradeoff in terms of area and power. The passive integrators have optimal power but suboptimal area, while the active integrators have optimal area and sub-optimal power consumption. The proposed work tries to break this tradeoff using BTBT regime loop filters. The CTDSM was designed in a GF45RFSOI technology and achieves a peak SNR/SNDR of 48.41 dB/47.94 dB for a 5 kHz bandwidth. The power consumption is 76.3 nW, with an area of 102.7 μm2 — more than 100x area reduction over previous state-of-the-art moderate-precision CTDSM designs.

Efficient delivery of high-quality power from PCB to POLs is a primary concern in modern high-power high-density integrated systems. With traditional power delivery approaches, high voltage is converted to high current on PCB, yielding prohibitively high power loss in horizontal packaging interconnect components. One approach to reduce this loss is with vertical power delivery (VPD), i.e., to deliver low current at high voltage horizontally and convert it to high current low voltage close to POLs. Voltage regulators (VRs) integrated within small footprint near POLs, however, exhibit high switching and inductor losses. As a result, state-of-the-art VPD systems still exhibit high IR voltage drops, power efficiency of less than 70%, and high thermal dissipation. Thus, the design of compact power efficient VRs is a primary concern with VPD approach. To enhance the overall performance of the PCB-to-POL power delivery system, distributed VPD is considered and architecture-specific design of VRs is investigated in this paper. The design methodology for determining optimal number and placement of VRs for a given power delivery architecture is also proposed. The approach has been demonstrated with on-interposer 12V/1V power converters, comprising Gallium Nitride (GaN) power devices and state-ofthe-art inductors and capacitors, yielding 85% power efficiency with 1-kA load at 2 A/mm2.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558456","distributed vertical power delivery;12V/1V;point-of-load (POL);high current density;high power;3D;2.5D;interposer","Low voltage;Regulators;Integrated circuit interconnections;High-voltage techniques;Switches;Packaging;System-on-chip","","","","12","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, It decomposes the original large MLP into two smaller branches. For each ray, GNeRF utilizes one branch to predict the important samples based on the direction information adaptively. The RGB calculations are then solely performed on these important samples using the other branch. Experimental results show that GNeRF can achieve comparable PSNR with only 3% FLOPS of the original NeRF. To showcase the hardware efficiency of GNeRF, we also design an FPGA-based NeRF accelerator on Xilinx ZCU102 MPSoC. Evaluation reveals that GNeRF can significantly enhance inference performance with minimal modifications to the existing MLP engine.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558296","Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF);adaptive sample gating;accelerator;image rendering","Three-dimensional displays;Adaptive systems;Circuits and systems;Rendering (computer graphics);Prediction algorithms;Inference algorithms;Real-time systems","","","","14","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The influence of these design parameters on the effectively required area per bit remains overlooked, since optimization on area is mostly done simply by designing small ROs. This work establishes a relationship between the general design parameters and the area per bit for RO-PUFs. Using finite frequency readout resolution by means of a limited readout time, the RO-PUF is transformed into graph-theory and by finding a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), the best possible yield of a given collection of ROs is determined. The given collection together with variable yield is then mapped to a certain demand on area per bit. An extensive yield analysis is performed which then is again mapped to a certain area per bit, leading to the proposed connection between readout time, amount of ROs in a collection and area per bit.The system-level analysis performed shows that a set of 8 ROs represents a sweet-spot in terms of area per bit as well as low read-out time.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558478","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558478","Physical Unclonable Function;Ring Oscillator;RO-PUF;Graph Theory;Minimum Spanning Tree","Ring oscillators;Time-frequency analysis;Power demand;Art;Circuits and systems;Stability analysis;Graph theory","","","","10","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The antenna's offset structure enables it to detect PD events near a conducting ground wire without being clamped to the wire like the typical high-frequency current transformer (HFCT). Meanwhile, its equivalent circuit is modeled as a ladder-structure band-pass filter (within the consideration of mutual inductances) to realize its wideband properties.

However, running LLMs on edge devices is challenging as they require large amounts of energy due to their memory and computation needs. In LLMs most of the memory is needed to store the model parameters which number keeps increasing from one LLM generation to the next. In the last several years, significant efforts have been made to compress and prune parameters, but this is not enough to reduce their memory needs as the number of parameters grows exponentially. In this work, to reduce energy dissipation, rather than trying to reduce the amount of memory used by LLMs, we study the use of approximate memories to store the LLM parameters. Approximate memories can significantly reduce the energy dissipation at the cost of introducing errors in some of the memory bits. Therefore, the impact of errors on LLMs must be understood. To that end, we have performed error injection on different compressed versions of a classic LLM: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). The results show that in some cases compressed BERTs operate reliably at high bit error rates. This makes possible the use of approximate memories with a negligible impact on the LLM performance and a significant reduction in energy dissipation.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558275","LLMs;approximate computing;memories","Computational modeling;Bit error rate;Energy dissipation;Memory management;Bidirectional control;Voltage;Transformers","","2","","25","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the power consumption and the reconfiguration delay still need improvement for what is required at GHz frequencies, thus delaying their commercial adaptation. On that regard, this study proposes the incorporation of Integrated Circuits (ICs) with MOS varactor loadings as part of the RIS framework, to improve power consumption and speed, while having precise tuning of the reflection phase for individual unit-cells. The presented circuit design features an asynchronous digital circuit responsible for transmitting binary streams to digital-to-analogue converters, which in turn, bias MOS varactors that are directly connected to each unit-cell within the RIS. The use of asynchronous digital control circuits facilitates the development of ultra-low power, high-speed ICs, thereby enhancing the dynamic scalability of the RIS system. Simulated results of the asynchronous circuit are presented on a mature, cost-effective, CMOS 0.18 μm process technology, showing static power consumption of 40,63 μW, dynamic energy consumption of 474.43 pJ and reconfiguration delay of 23.38 ns. The simulations are accompanied by a scalability analysis and a discussion of potential capabilities, offering valuable insights for the future of ICs on RIS systems.

Moreover, the fixed bootstrap capacitance limits the practicality in monolithic gate drivers and only few GaN transistors with certain gate charge (Qg) range can be used.

Since convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often prioritize local texture over global shape which also limits generalization, we then introduce the concept of local self-information into the texture probability (TP) loss to reduce over-focus of CNN on local textures. To avoid model convergence to saddle points during training which yields varying outcomes and unstable performance, we finally conclude with a meta-learner which combines results from multiple models to improve stability and better decision-making.

There is a need to enable spatio-temporal SR with minimal hardware overhead on devices that already have the SR module. The proposed model demonstrates an example of hardware implementation by combining independent hardware-friendly spatial SR and frame interpolation (FI). This configuration allows for seamless support of spatial SR, temporal SR, and spatio-temporal SR functionalities through data flow reconfiguration.

Over the past year, there have been more than ten serious attacks against cross-chain bridges, resulting in billions of dollars in losses. Among these attacks, fake deposits stand out as particularly destructive. Hackers can perpetrate such attacks by verifying the authenticity of proof associated with fake deposits on the target blockchain, subsequently pilfering the assets. However, existing tools have limitations in detecting this type of attack. To address this problem, this work proposes a tool to protect cross-chain bridges from fake deposit attacks by analyzing the network of transaction traces. Specifically, the framework first records the execution traces for each transaction, and then extracts the relevant contract interactions therein to extract statistical and structural features. Finally, real case labels are utilized to identify attacking and non-attacking transactions. We conducted experiments to validate the tool’s effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, for the detection of fake deposit transactions, our method achieved an average precision of 0.89, a recall value of 0.83, and the ability to identify 38.65 transactions per second.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558359","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558359","Trace Network;Security;Blockchain;Crosschain Bridge","Bridges;Knowledge engineering;Computer hacking;Bridge circuits;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Blockchains","","","","23","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-level RRAM cells have been investigated to improve memory density and cost-per-bit. However, sensing multi-level becomes challenging due to the smaller R-ratios between stored digital values. This paper introduces a novel time-based sensing (TBS) scheme for enhancing the robustness and speed of the read operation, supporting from single-level cells (SLC) to multi-level cells (MLC). In the proposed time-based sensing scheme, the current-to-time converter (CTC) converts the bit line (BL) current into a time delay based on the cell states. Different time delays from HRS and LRS values are compared to generate digital data. Unlike conventional current-based sense amplifiers (CSA) or voltage-based sense amplifiers (VSA), the proposed sensing scheme does not require a reference array or generator. Comprehensive simulation in 40nm CMOS technology shows enhanced linearity and higher read speed because of the precise replication of cell current to CTC. As a result, the proposed TBS achieves a sensing latency of < 2ns with an energy consumption of 61fJ/bit for read operations at 1.1 V and also supports MLC sensing through a single read operation.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558025","Resistive random access memory (RRAM);time-based sensing (TBS);multi-level cell (MLC);current-to-time converter (CTC)","Resistance;Energy consumption;Delay effects;Resistive RAM;Linearity;Voltage;Phase change random access memory","","","","26","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the system response is sparse, NAFs are further combined with proportionate-type algorithms to accelerate system identification which increases the computational complexity further. To alleviate the NAF complexity problem, a block-oriented functional link adaptive filter (BO-FLAF) algorithm, which has lower complexity and filter order than the FLAF was recently proposed. Since proportionate adaptation complexity is directly proportional to the filter order, a proportionate BO-FLAF is more attractive from a computation standpoint than the existing proportionate FLAF (PFLAF). Therefore, we develop a novel proportionate Hammerstein BO-FLAF (PHBO-FLAF) in this paper. Through theoretical complexity analysis we prove that the proposed PHBO trigonometric FLAF (PHBO-TFLAF) has 53.2% lesser multiplications and 7 times less logarithmic operations than the PTFLAF.

The proposed MStoLIHT algorithm is based upon Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and employs the Lorentzian norm of residual as the underlying cost function which provides robustness against impulsive errors in the measurements. Each iteration of the MStoLIHT algorithm consists of multiple subiterations. At each iteration, only a block of rows of the sensing matrix is used for carrying out the update, and at each subiteration, only few of the columns of the estimated data matrix are updated based on the SGD and the HT strategies. At the end of subiterations, another HT operation is performed ensuring the row sparsity in the estimated data matrix. Extensive numerical simulations are carried out, which indicate that by updating the data matrix in blocks of columns followed by HT operation, the performance in terms of probability of support recovery is improved when compared to its deterministic counterpart. It is further observed that the MStoLIHT algorithm outperforms other existing algorithms for the MMV problem in literature.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558567","Multiple Measurement Vectors (MMV);Impulsive noise;Hard Thresholding;Stochastic Gradient Descent;Lorentzian norm","Circuits and systems;Measurement uncertainty;Numerical simulation;Cost function;Vectors;Robustness;Sensors","","","","24","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, standard mixed precision benefits remain limited due to the 1-bit frontier, that forces each parameter to be encoded on at least 1 bit of data. This paper introduces an approach that combines mixed precision, zero-point quantization and entropy coding to push the compression boundary of Resnets beyond the 1-bit frontier with an accuracy drop below 1% on the ImageNet benchmark.

On the one hand, transmitting the massive information requires plenty of bandwidth. On the other hand, processing these data requires tremendous manpower. In order to solve these two problems at the same time, image coding for machines (ICM) came into being. At present, most ICM technologies combine traditional codecs such as BPG or machine learning codecs such as the hyperprior codec and the coarse-to-fine codec with task networks such as image classification and semantic segmentation. This process requires the complete restoration of the image, which greatly increases the bitrates. Moreover, the restored images are for human eyes and contain a large amount of redundant information, which is not required by the task network. In order to solve this problem, side information driven image coding for machines (SIIC) was proposed, which only needs to input hyperprior information to the image classification network, which greatly reduces the scale of data transmission. Now, we propose a redundancy removal module that can further reduce the usage of bitrates for SIIC. Through this module, the new codec uses 3% to 4% less bitrates than the original SIIC when the bitrates are under 0.06 bpp, and can save up to 10% of bitrates when the bitrates are over 0.1 bpp.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10557851","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10557851","bitrate;image classification;image coding for machines;redundancy removal;transpose convolution","Codecs;Image coding;Surveillance;Semantic segmentation;Bit rate;Redundancy;Image restoration","","","","17","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, those prior works have suffered from an unnecessary large number of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations and/or main memory accesses. In this paper, we propose HeNCoG, a GCN accelerator that utilizes a heterogeneous MAC array core for the combination stage and a near-memory computing core for the aggregation stage. In HeNCoG, considering that the number of MAC operations is significantly reduced when changing the stage execution order, the combination stage is executed first with a row-stationary dataflow. In the aggregation stage, magneto-resistive random-access memory (MRAM)-based near-memory computing is employed to reduce the number of main memory accesses needed to access the adjacency matrix in the graph dataset. Graph partitioning and double buffering techniques are also applied to further improve hardware efficiencies. Simulation results show that the HeNCoG architecture reduces execution cycles by 97% and memory accesses by 42% compared to previous works.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558133","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558133","Graph Convolutional Network;Sparse Matrix Multiplication;Near-memory Computing;Domain Specific Accelerator","Circuits and systems;Magnetic cores;Simulation;Memory architecture;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Partitioning algorithms","","","","16","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most quantization studies focused on weight and activation parameters. However, gradient quantization, which is the core of quantization research for CNN training, has a significant impact on network training even with small changes in gradient, making it difficult to achieve excellent accuracy. Although previous works for gradient quantization achieved high accuracy based on stochastic rounding (SR), there are issues of high latency in generating random numbers and difficulty with register transfer level (RTL)-based hardware design. Additionally, the search for a clipping value based on quantization error is effective in the initial training but becomes inadequate after model convergence as the quantization error decreases. In this paper, we address the limitations of SR through an approach based on deterministic rounding, specifically rounding toward zero (RTZ). Additionally, to determine the outliers in a distribution, we search for a suitable clipping value based on the z-score, that would be appropriate even if the network converges. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy in various vision tasks, such as ResNet, YOLOv5, and YOLACT, and offers robust compatibility. The proposed quantizer was verified through RTL, achieving an accuracy similar to that of SR using resources comparable to nearest rounding. Moreover, when measuring latency on the CPU, the proposed method achieved 43% less latency than SR.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558001","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558001","Deep learning;Convolutional neural network;Gradient quantization;Low-power design","Training;YOLO;Quantization (signal);Accuracy;Convolution;Stochastic processes;Hardware","","2","","32","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While wired-logic processors have achieved several orders of magnitude higher energy efficiency than conventional FPGA-based deep neural network (DNN) processors on the CIFAR-10 dataset by eliminating DRAM/BRAM access during inference processing, huge hardware resources are required for the large-scale DNNs with long-bit-width data. Implementing even small DNNs proves challenging as they surpass the hardware resources available in commercial FPGAs. To address these issues and enable the implementation of larger-scale neural networks alongside the processing of long-bit-width data, two techniques are proposed: (1) an LUT segmentation technique based on coarse and fine granularity, and (2) accuracy optimization through the incorporation of redundant bits. The application of these proposed techniques to state-of-the-art wired-logic processors markedly enhances the scalability of a single FPGA, thereby facilitating the implementation of larger-scale neural networks across various tasks, including CIFAR-10 classification and keyword spotting. The hardware resource requirements for non-linear functions in processing elements decreased by 92%, and 92.8%, respectively.

Besides many works aiming at a resource efficient but still accurate semantic segmentation, the possibility to adapt the segmentation model to specific circumstances is missing. In this work, we present a novel approach for flexible semantic segmentation that builds on recent developments in segmentation foundation models and prompt tuning. The approach offers the possibility to trade off inference time and accuracy, to flexibly select the classes to be segmented, and to add new target classes to an existing system just by transferring new prompts.

Many approximate binary multipliers that use 4-2 compressors have been proposed but most of the proposals have error performances that depend on the order in which the inputs are connected to the compressors. This complicates the design and prevents a fair comparison among different approximate multipliers. The paper proposes the input order invariant approximate 4-2 compressors, whose behavior remains consistent regardless of the order of input signals. We derive the complete set of such compressors and utilize them to synthesize 8-bit multipliers. Our analysis reveals that only a limited subset of input order invariant approximate 4-2 compressors offers an optimal balance between error and power savings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this optimal set of 4-2 compressors can be strategically distributed within the columns of the multiplier to further enhance the trade-off between error and power efficiency.

However, due to technology limits, RRAM device faces a series of reliability issues. Deep neural network (DNN) computing based on RRAM suffers from accuracy degradation. On the one hand, offline DNN training solutions are difficult to fully consider and simulate all nonidealities. Worse still, new error or nonideality may come up with the usage of RRAM, which further deteriorates the effectiveness of offline training. On the other hand, online training poses great challenges on programming overhead and device lifetime. The iterative write-verify technique to program multi-bit RRAM cells prolongs write latency more than 10× longer than read latency. To overcome these issues, we propose a compensation architecture and a software and hardware co-training design to mitigate the realistic network accuracy loss in RRAM-based computing-in-memory chips. Firstly, we add trainable compensation channels in crossbars utilizing the residual resource after original weight mapping. Secondly, an offline training procedure with computing output from hardware is triggered to settle down appropriate weight value in compensation channels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design can guarantee ≤ 0.8% loss of accuracy in DNN on MNIST and CIFAR10 dataset even when nonidealities reduce the original accuracy down to ≤73%.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558665","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558665","RRAM;reliability;architecture design;network training","Training;Accuracy;Resistive RAM;Noise;Artificial neural networks;Computer architecture;Programming","","","","19","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the techniques for increasing the data rate that can be transmitted through a resonant link is to reset the state variables on both the primary and secondary sides of the inductively coupled link after each symbol. This removes inter-symbol interference but reduces the received signal amplitude. Another technique, specific to frequency-shift keying (FSK), is to modulate the resonance frequency of the primary side in accordance with the transmitted frequency. This preserves the signal amplitude but can be applied only on the primary side. This paper compares the performance of these techniques. It is shown that the received signal amplitude is twice as much in resonance-frequency modulation compared to state-variable reset.

Each analog deobfuscation algorithm considers different threat models, applies to only a small set of obfuscation techniques, and suffers adversely under real world scenarios, where one or more pieces of information on the circuit and obfuscation technique or techniques is unavailable to the attacker. In this paper, a novel DC nodal analysis (DNA) attack algorithm is proposed that requires only the circuit netlist and the DC input-output response of the oracle IC to perform the attack. The DNA attack utilizes Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) and Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) to efficiently characterize an obfuscated analog circuit with the objective of determining the correct locked parameters. A preliminary evaluation of the proposed attack is performed on three distinct analog circuits secured using both key-based parameter obfuscation and non-key-based multi-threshold obfuscation. The results from executing the attack on a secured single-stage analog circuit with key-based obfuscation indicate the successful elimination of, on average, 96% of keys from the search space. The results from executing the attack on two-stage circuits secured with multi-threshold obfuscation indicate that 99.58% of the keys are eliminated in less than 7 hours. With the limited information necessary to perform the attack, the efficiency in pruning the key-space when considering real attack scenarios, and the application of the attack to all current analog obfuscation techniques, the DNA attack provides the de-facto standard in the characterization of the resiliency of an analog obfuscated circuit.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10557905","National Science Foundation; Office of Naval Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10557905","analog obfuscation;circuit design;SAT;SMT","Threat modeling;Circuits and systems;DNA;Analog circuits;Aerospace electronics;Threshold voltage;Standards","","","","9","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Bit-serial DNN designs with only shift-add operations are more flexible for computation when the per-layer bit-widths are different in aggressive model quantization. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is a common non-linear activation function after each layer of DNN computation where negative values are replaced by zeros. Thus, early-termination could be employed to reduce ineffective computation, resulting in improved speed performance and reduced energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a new bit-serial computation style by re-organizing data in bit-plane order. We observe that bit-plane computation allows more efficient early-termination. The proposed bit-plane DNN design is also extended to digit-plane through radix-4 Booth recoding, leading to a smaller area cost.

The un-reliable ANN leads to un-trustable inference results and disasters (e.g., finance system or transportation system crash). To ensure hardware reliability, the common way is to insert some error correctness blocks or fault-tolerant computing blocks, which bring considerable hardware overhead and are improper to the resource-limited edge AI designs. To design hardware-friendly and highly reliable hardware, the Stochastic Computing (SC) method has been proven to be an efficient way to achieve fault-tolerant computing goals. Consequently, many SC-based computing architectures have been introduced recently. However, because of the stochastic number representation, the computing accuracy issue is the design challenge to implement the SC-based computing architecture. To solve this problem, we propose a novel scaling-free adder and input data pre-processing method to achieve a reliable SC-based computing architecture and improve the accuracy of conventional SC-based ANN design. Compared with the traditional ANN design, the proposed SC-based ANN design maintains computing accuracy and enhances the performance by 32% to 55% while facing serious fault injection.

This method updates the important channels and layers only and skips gradient computation for the less important channels and layers to reduce memory usage for each update iteration. In addition, the channel selection is dynamic for different iterations to traverse most of the parameters in the update layers along the time dimension for better performance. The experimental result shows that the proposed method enables an ImageNet pre-trained MobileNetV2 trained on CIFAR-10 to achieve an accuracy of 85.77% while updating only 2% of convolution weights within 256KB on-chip memory.

Besides, how to alleviate the problem of occlusion is ignored in most existing work. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an Occlusion-Augmented Localization Network (OALNet), which extracts multiple occluded features of exemplars for comparison and utilizes the precise position of instances for more accurate and confident counting results. Specifically, the OALNet is in an extract-and-attention manner. It includes an Occluded Feature Generation module to deal with the occlusion problem in query images. Besides, the OALNet adopts the Feature Attention module to improve the extracted feature by self-attention and model the relationship between the exemplar features and query features by cross-attention.

However, computing the inner product of a pair of variable vectors is frequently used for matrix multiplication of various forms and convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we present a novel DA-based architecture for computing the inner product of variable vectors. To derive the proposed architecture, the inner product of any given length is decomposed into a set of short-length inner products, such that the inner product could be computed by successive accumulation of the results of short-length inner products. We have designed a DA-based architecture for the computation of the short-length inner-product of variable vectors and used that in successive clock cycles to compute the whole inner-product by successive accumulation.

Consequently, we propose a new DehazeDiff framework for image dehazing based on DDPM, aiming to explore a new solution. Firstly, a feature extraction network is introduced to extract the potential features from haze images to clear images, which are then fed into the diffusion model for further feature refinement.

For mobile/edge devices, energy and area efficiency are critical concerns. This research proposes a row-based pipelined DNN training accelerator that employs three techniques to improve energy and area efficiency for resource-constrained edge/mobile devices. The first technique involves freezing weight updates in convolution and batch normalization layers. The second technique involves decomposing the simulated quantization for convolutional layers and reorganizing the operations of batch normalization layers. The mathematical demonstration shows that FP convolution operations can be completed using fixed point (FXP) calculations. FXP MACs with dequantizer can replace the original FP MACs for convolutional layers. Additionally, a row-based FXP/FP pipelined training accelerator is designed for layers pipeline, convolution, and batch normalization layers to increase the FXP and FP resource utilization.

In this paper, we propose an FFT accelerator, named RbFFT, optimized for the MIMO radar processing chain. The architecture of RbFFT reduces the overhead by re-using existing memory in the processing element (PE), and employs a dual-radix butterfly engine with mixed bit resolution to optimize resources in dense radars. RbFFT reduces area by implementing for the first time ultra-low compression in its dual twiddle factor ROM. RbFFT also innovates with custom fetching and buffering strategies to improve memory-based FFTs while reusing logic to integrate reverse bit ordering, windowing and inverse FFT (IFFT) within the same accelerator passes. The proposed accelerator is implemented in a 25-Core Smart MPSoC in 22FDX using Adaptive Body Biasing (ABB) at 0.6V. Besides RbFFT being pioneer in specialized FFT accelerators for dense MIMO systems, the results also show state-of-the-art improvements via 11% reduction in the normalized energy consumption, 4% reduction in latency, and 11 times area reduction with relation to previous silicon implementations.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558386","","MIMO radar;Digital signal processors;Radar;Radar imaging;Radar antennas;Silicon;Radar signal processing","","1","","25","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome those threats, Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) has been considered one of the security primitives for secret keys or unique IDs due to the characteristic of stable, random, and unique responses. However, most existing PUF designs, which operate independently of the original circuit, are vulnerable to removal attacks and result in substantial resource overhead. To address these issues, authors in [5] proposed parallel scan-chain PUF, which is built on the standard Design-for-Testability (DFT) structure of scan flip-flops. However, aging effects, such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) and Hot Carriers Injection (HCI), significantly impact input conditions between two Scan Flip-Flops (SFFs) in normal mode, leading to complex Error Correction Codes (ECC) and increased area overhead. Therefore, we introduce a novel design to mitigate aging effects, enhance reliability, and analyze the parallel scan-chain PUF structure to identify error causes. Besides, to decrease the errors caused by aging effects, we use the proposed aging compensator to offset the delay between two different SFFs after aging mutually. Additionally, we incorporate signal gating for the arbiter, mitigating unbalanced aging effects and saving power consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the responses from an average error rate of 39.96% to less than 7.5% within 10 years. Moreover, with the complexity of ECC reduced, it offers ~8x overhead reduction for the Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) encoder and decoder.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558312","PUF;Parallel scan-chain PUF;aging;ECC","Error analysis;Aging;Physical unclonable function;Error correction codes;Decoding;Trojan horses;Transistors","","","","26","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CVDs can be preliminarily diagnosed by analyzing a patient’s electrocardiogram (ECG), which requires long-term continuous ECG monitoring to suitably detect the onset of the disease. However, ECG data acquisition involves multiple lead attachments and requires regular intervention by an expert, thereby making the process cumbersome and inappropriate for continuous health monitoring due to limited portability and discomfort caused to the patients. Nowadays, automated ECG measurement techniques are gaining popularity in wearable health monitoring applications to seamlessly identify cardiac abnormalities even in a home environment. On the other hand, photoplethysmography (PPG) signals can be acquired from the wrist or fingertip of a patient by using a lead-less patch-less set-up that can be easily integrated with smart wearable devices. Therefore, to address the aforementioned demerits associated with ECG devices, a few researchers have fostered the idea of reconstructing ECG from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals to generate simple yet effective CVD monitoring methodologies. Hence, in this paper, we propose P2E-LGAN, a hybrid generative adversarial network (GAN) based framework for generating ECG from PPG. The proposed network is evaluated on a benchmark database combined with ECG and PPG data. The inclusion of LSTM in the GAN network reduces the root mean square (RMSE), mean absolute error of heart rate (MAE(HR)) and percentage root mean square difference (PRD) by 35.7%, 37.2% and 9.8% respectively.

Estimating the interconnect impedance of analog circuits at early design stages has been a persistent challenge, primarily due to the lack of detailed layout information. Even with accurate parasitic extraction after routing, many iterations of modifications to the design are required to compensate for the effects of interconnect impedance. To address this challenge, a novel approach is proposed in this work that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) for the estimation of the interconnect capacitance of an analog circuit at both the schematic and post-placement stages of the design flow. A device-level circuit is represented as a heterogeneous graph, where two node types are utilized, one representing transistors and the other representing nets. The GNN model, specifically, the relational GraphSAGE network, is applied to update the embeddings of net nodes, which are then used to predict the lumped capacitance of a net. To allow the model to learn the spatial relationships between devices after placement, the pairwise Manhattan distances between devices are utilized as edge weights during the aggregation of node embeddings. A dataset of ten analog circuits is utilized to evaluate the proposed model. The developed GNN model for post-placement prediction of capacitance that utilizes pairwise Manhattan distances results in an R2 score of 0.73 and a mean absolute error of 0.26 fF, outperforming both the schematic-level prediction model and the post-placement prediction model that directly utilizes device coordinates as features. Results confirm that the proposed model effectively estimates the interconnect capacitance of analog circuits at early design stages while requiring a small dataset for training.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558681","National Science Foundation; Office of Naval Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558681","","Training;Integrated circuit interconnections;Estimation;Predictive models;Analog circuits;Capacitance;Routing","","","","14","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, they have been rarely used in model implementations, despite their promising impact on performance and efficiency in tasks that exhibit complex dynamics, as it has been unclear how to optimize them. In this work, we propose a framework to train and deploy in digital neuromorphic hardware highly performing spiking neural networks (SNNs) where apart from the synaptic weights, the delays are also co-optimized. We consider synaptic (i.e. per-synapse) delays and evaluate them in two neuromorphic digital hardware platforms: Intel's Loihi and Imec's Seneca. Leveraging spike-based back-propagation-through-time, the training process accounts for both platform constraints, such as synaptic weight precision and the total number of parameters per core, as a function of the network size. In addition, a delay pruning technique is used to reduce memory footprint with a low cost in performance. The evaluated benchmark involves several models for solving the SHD (Spiking Heidelberg Digits) classification task, where minimal accuracy degradation during the transition from software to hardware is demonstrated. To our knowledge, this is the first work show-casing how to train and deploy hardware-aware models parameterized with synaptic delays, on multicore neuromorphic hardware accelerators.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558209","Spiking Neural Networks;Synaptic Delays;Temporal Signal Analysis;Spiking Heidelberg Digits","Training;Degradation;Costs;Neuromorphics;Benchmark testing;Software;Delays","","","","32","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we proposed an ultra-low power application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that can detect the P, R, and T peaks of the Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. These peaks are useful for early detection of CVDs. The proposed design consists of a low-power analog front end followed by a peak-detection circuit, which can detect the P, R, and T peaks from an incoming single-lead differential ECG signal. The time-varying amplitude difference between the adjacent ECG peaks are efficiently detected by the proposed design. The proposed peak detector circuit has a self-adjustable discharge rate, which depends on the amplitude of the peak. The circuit is designed at the sub-threshold region to reduce the power consumption of the overall design. The proposed design extracts the digital output with the temporal information from the peaks of the ECG signal without using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), one of the most power-hungry blocks in conventional biomedical signal acquisition architectures. A test chip has been fabricated in an industrial 0.18 µm CMOS process and occupies an active area of only 0.848 mm2. Measured results show that the proposed design consumes only 299.45 nW of power with a supply voltage of 0.9 V at typical operating conditions, which represents an improvement of 27.07%, 34.57%, and 51.93% over the existing state-of-the-art design.

It offers some notable advantages when compared to conventional back-propagation-based algorithms and to classical design methods. From an implementation perspective, it demands only a single computational circuit. Theoretically, although it seeks to minimize a cost function, it exhibits similarities to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), rendering it, to a certain extent, biologically plausible. This paper explores the global dynamic behavior of continuous-time piecewise linear networks trained through equilibrium point propagation. We examine a network in which the target patterns are presented as external inputs rather than as initial conditions. We first show that the learning rules, which extend equilibrium propagation to gradient-like and non-symmetric networks, can be derived as a suitable approximation of Lagrangian optimization. Then, by studying a relatively simple but thoroughly significant case, we demonstrate that a detailed analysis of the equilibrium point distribution yields a profound understanding of the network’s fundamental properties and provides a valuable tool for quantitatively evaluating the network’s accuracy. Compared to classical synthesis techniques, our approach, where patterns are introduced as external inputs, in most cases, circumvents the impractical task of estimating the basins of attraction for sets of multiple equilibrium points. Furthermore, preliminary extensive simulations indicate that the primary dynamic features observed in relatively small networks closely resemble those ensuring the performance and accuracy of large-scale networks.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10557843","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10557843","","Training;Accuracy;Recurrent neural networks;Heuristic algorithms;Design methodology;Rendering (computer graphics);Cost function","","","","14","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problems impact the system performance and damage the system reliability. The practical way to monitor the system temperature is to place number-limited thermal sensors on multi-core systems. Unfortunately, finding proper locations for thermal sensor placement is an NP-hard problem. Many pieces of research proposed methods to allocate number-limited thermal sensors under different perspectives. However, the conventional methods still do not consider the time-varying temperature distribution or the correlation between different thermal hotspot points. To solve these problems, we apply the Q-learning method to assist with thermal sensor placements determined by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) theory. While LASSO primarily excels in feature selection, Q-learning is better equipped to handle dynamic environmental changes and interdependencies. Thus, we employ the Q-learning method to formulate a precise cost function for accurately estimating the outcomes following the placement of a thermal sensor at a specific location. Compared with the state-of-the-art, our proposed methods, using both the LASSO-based method and the Q-learning Assisted LASSO method, reduce the average errors by 67%-85% and 69%-87%, respectively, and the maximum errors by 80%-92% and 82%-93%.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558360","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558360","thermal sensor;multi-core system;LASSO;Q-learning;sensor placement","Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Sensor placement;Temperature distribution;Q-learning;System performance;Sensor phenomena and characterization","","","","19","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike conventional sensors, NVSs only generate asynchronous spiking events in response to changes in light intensity. However, the inherent noise generated by NVSs causes a degradation of detection performance. Moreover, an interested object usually occupies only a portion of the entire image frame. Therefore, a real-time, accurate event-based object detection system is needed to identify the region of interest (Rol) and leverage this spatial redundancy to reduce computational load in subsequent recognition modules. In this article, we present an energy-efficient real-time object detection system featuring a hybrid event-based frame generation pipeline and a background-removal region proposal algorithm. The event-based frame is generated by aggregating active events within a programmable time interval, generating an event-based binary image (EBBI). This approach enables the utilization of low-complexity algorithms for denoising and object detection. The background-removal region proposal algorithm reduces memory requirements and removes dynamic backgrounds, leading to better detection performance. The proposed system is demonstrated on Zynq-7000 FPGA device with a DAVIS346 sensor.

Negative-R assisted integrators have been introduced to reduce the CTDSMs sensitivity to OA non-idealities, where the negative-R has shown linearity improvements in low-power CTDSMs for relatively narrow bandwidth applications. However, the negative-R concept has not been widely applied for wideband applications. Wide-band CTDSMs in particular are more sensitive to the non-idealities of the OA GBW and especially in the associated phase-shift compared to their narrow-band counterparts. This paper provides insight into the effect of negative-R assistance on the GBW of the OA, where it is shown, that the phase-shift of the integrator due to finite GBW is not reduced by the negative-R assistance, and still remains an issue to be considered in the design of a wide-band CTDSMs.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558442","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558442","","Sensitivity;Circuits and systems;Modulation;Linearity;Dynamic range;Delta-sigma modulation;Circuit stability","","","","17","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a resource-efficient scheme for weight pattern sharing (ReShare). A pattern reorder algorithm is introduced to facilitate the asynchronous running of computations and sharing, which circumvents the bottleneck posed by the output buffer in a conventional sharing scheme. In addition, ReShare enables block write operations to reduce write costs. Our evaluation across four DNN models demonstrates that the proposed ReShare has a lighter overhead in energy and storage while simultaneously enhancing performance.

This paper proposes an effective method to create a 4 × 4 S-Box with strong cryptographic properties based on a one-dimensional chaotic map, which is the enhanced tent map. The algorithm used to create S-Boxes uses parameters based on the fundamental characteristics of an S-Box. The cryptanalysis results show that the created S-Box satisfies high-security properties. The output Bit Independence Criterion (BIC) and Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC) simultaneously reach the ideal value, which no other S-Boxes have ever achieved.

Consequently, it attains impressive energy efficiency of 310 pJ per channel. Employing a time-domain interface approach, the IC directly converts sensor resistance into time, extending its measurement capabilities up to 10 MΩ.

However, unlike CLS, which requires three phases, the proposed flip-around level-shifting requires only two clock phases and hence is highly efficient when used with dynamic amplifiers, like the floating inverter amplifier (FIA). We show that this technique has a much faster closed-loop settling than conventional SC amplifiers, resulting in significant power savings in the FIA.

The output impedance of a SL converter is inductive in nature, which prevents the delivery of the high-frequency content of the envelope in wide-bandwidth signals. On the other hand, the proposed SC supply modulator is not limited by an inductive impedance, and hence, inherently exhibits immediate response, which facilitates high-efficiency ET despite the increasing bandwidth of RF signals. Additionally, SC supply modulators require only switches and capacitor, which can be integrated on the same transmitter microchip using the high-Q capacitors available in typical CMOS processes. Conversely, existing supply modulators require multiple off-chip or in-package inductors to realize high efficiency, which increase form factor and cost.

This proximity to data sources brings significant business benefits such as faster insights, improved response time, and better bandwidth availability. Consequently, edge computing technologies have witnessed widespread adoption. Edge computing faces significant security challenges due to factors like limited cost, volume, and power consumption, as well as the potential risk of quantum computers breaking conventional cryptographic systems. Limitation of computing power in edge computing nodes further complicates the system architecture to achieve secure data transmission. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight trusted inference mechanism specifically designed for edge computing workloads. The primary objective of this mechanism is to establish a balance between security and bandwidth by incorporating a post-quantum encryption to the edge computing devices. This is achieved through sharing convolution and encryption hardware at the edge while encrypting and transmitting intermediate results of inference computations to the cloud, thereby minimizing resource usage and transmission bandwidth requirements. The FPGA platform is utilized to implement a template hardware design, which demonstrated comparable resource consumption to the stateof-art work.

In this work, we propose Tetris-SDK, a novel tool that exploits adaptive windows to further improve the performance of convolution layer mapping. These windows can accommodate a larger number of input channels, increase array utilization at marginal space, and adjust window shapes to minimize compute latency. Our experiments with a 512 × 512 CIM array demonstrate that Tetris-SDK remarkably accelerates CNN layers up to 78.4×, 8×, and 1.3× compared to the baseline mapping algorithms, i.e., img2col, SDK, and VW-SDK, respectively.

The converter consists of two strings of PV cells. Instead of switching costly passive elements (i.e., inductors or capacitors) to perform input-to-output voltage conversion, one PV string is switched up and down periodically with respect to the other fixed string. In this way, the intrinsic capacitance in the flying PV string is used to shuttle any mismatch charge, induced by nonuniform illumination across a solar panel, sequentially between each two series-connected cells in a string to the output. Additionally, the implicit switched-capacitor ladder converter, established by the PV cells internal capacitance, allows reconfiguring the converter output terminal location within the fixed ladder, and hence the employed voltage conversion ratio, without degrading harvesting efficiency. Simulation results of a proof-of-concept design using radiation-hardened GaN devices demonstrate the efficiency advantage of the proposed SPV ladder over prior solutions, where up to 43% and 63% improvements in the efficiency are realized.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10557846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10557846","photovoltaic (PV) cell;DC–DC converter;energy harvesting","Circuits and systems;Simulation;Lighting;Switches;Voltage;DC-DC power converters;Capacitance","","","","7","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We analyze why a constant dv/dt minimizes V-I overlap loss under a peak dv/dt specification, how to maintain a constant dv/dt during the MP period, and propose an implementable solution.

To manipulate the spin state of NV centers efficiently, we use two of the presented TX chips to drive a newly proposed differential resonator, which provides microwave magnetic fields of B1=179μT over a large active area of 18.48×104 μm2. Continuous-wave and pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements are used to verify the excellent performance of the proposed platform compared to the state-of-the-art.

The algorithm aims at balancing the errors between segments and solves the problem of excessive precision that exists in other PWL approximation methods and achieves on average 30.07× better mean squared error compared to the previous works. Based on this algorithm, we propose an activation function unit (AFU) which enables the addressing scheme of non-uniform segments and provides reconfigurability for all common activation functions by reloading parameters. End-to-end evaluation with several DNNs shows the accuracy loss is all less than 0.06% with 64 segments.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558019","equi-error partition;hardware architecture;piecewise linear approximation;non-uniform segments;activation function","Accuracy;Circuits and systems;Artificial neural networks;Approximation algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Approximation methods;Task analysis","","","","17","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been observed that propagation delay reduces with a symmetric increment of S/D LEXT. However, 4 ~ 5 nm of LEXT would be the optimum choice for source/drain extension length considering overshoot/undershoot. Away from this range of LEXT, a continued increment in overshoot/undershoot is observed owing to the increment/decrease in gate-to-drain resistance/capacitance, respectively.

By reusing the 64-point FFT module, computations are completed within four clock cycles, resulting in circuit area and power savings. We further leverage the semi-folded FFT structure to implement the FOE circuit. The experiments demonstrate that under the 28nm process technology, the semi-folded FFT achieves an area efficiency of 0.0043/(mm2 /GS) and a power efficiency of 2.44mW/GS when working at a frequency of 714MHz. Additionally, when working at 500MHz the semi-foleded based FOE circuit has an area of 0.787mm2 and a power consumption of 319.1mW, meets the requirements of a 256Gbps 16QAM communication system.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558294","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558294","Semi-folded FFT;frequency offset estimate;coherent optical communication","Local oscillators;Power demand;Parallel processing;Throughput;Hardware;Frequency estimation;Transceivers","","","","12","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The copper and carbon nanotube (Cu-CNT) composite based tapered TSV-bump structure offers superior electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical strength compared to standalone Cu or CNT materials, making them an ideal choice. It is crucial to model the electrical characteristics of Cu-CNT based TSVs-bump, and this can be achieved by employing the effective complex conductivity approach. A comprehensive model, denoted by resistance-inductance-conductance-capacitance (RLGC), is implemented to consider the influences of both the inter-metal dielectric and bump effects. The computation of TSV-bump parasitic is accomplished by applying the current continuity expression, utilizing the partial inductance method, and segmenting infinitesimally thin slices of the bump within a triangular configuration of tube assemblies. In order to validate the proposed model, the quantitative values of TSV-bump parasitics are compared with the EM simulations, revealing a notable conformity with an average deviation of only 2.9%. Further, the crosstalk-induced delay, insertion loss (S21), and reflection loss (S11) for the Cu, CNT, and composite Cu-CNT based tapered TSV-bump structure have been investigated by using a driver-via-load (DVL) in 7nm technology.

In contrast, weak PUFs exhibit inherent resistance to modeling attacks, but they suffer from a restricted number of Challenge-Response Pairs (CRPs), thus unsuitable for authentication. This paper proposes a PUF design that incorporates weak PUFs to obscure the responses of Strong PUFs, effectively safeguarding them from modeling attacks.

However, effectively leveraging the intrinsic, unstructured sparsity of SNNs in hardware is challenging, especially due to the variability in sparsity across network layers. This variability depends on several factors, including the input dataset, encoding scheme, and neuron model. Most existing SNN accelerators fail to account for the layer-specific workloads of an application (model + dataset), leading to high energy consumption. To address this, we propose a design-time parametric hardware generator that takes layer-wise sparsity and the number of processing elements as inputs and synthesizes the corresponding hardware. The proposed design compresses sparse spike trains using a priority encoder and efficiently shifts the activations across the network’s layers. We demonstrate the robustness of our proposed approach by first profiling a given application’s characteristics followed by performing efficient resource allocation.

One of the ways to reduce traffic congestion is to use effective routing methods to guide vehicles to their destinations that avoid or reduce traffic congestion. However, routing for vehicles, especially in urban areas, is difficult due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the transportation networks. To deal with these characteristics, the use of connected vehicles, which successfully obtain real-time data by using Internet communication, is attracting as the vehicles in the transportation networks. The ability to communicate over the Internet allows connected vehicles to communicate with other connected vehicles and infrastructure to monitor road congestion.

Recently, deep neural networks demonstrated state of the art performance on brain activity decoding, yet they come with the caveat of long training and execution times especially in CPUs compared to classical machine learning algorithms. A solution for optimizing the neural networks models execution is to use tailored software runtimes for the computation hardware. In this paper, we investigate the performances of such inference engines on electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI data decoding with neural networks. We compare the performances of three different inference engines against the PyTorch deep learning framework: Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) runtime, Intel OpenVINO and Apache TVM. For medium (38527 parameters) and small (3945 parameters) sizes networks, ONNX runtime achieves lesser time in model inference with 5-6x average speedup.

Unlike the backscatter, the received continuous wave (CW) is not reflected via impedance modulating at the antenna but is directed into the TRX to be modulated and amplified. This technique significantly extends the communication range at a low power consumption. A coupler serves to prevent the direct entry of transmitted signals into the receiving path, ensuring the received CW remains unaffected to be modulated.

Previous research has employed linear and multi-model linear models to capture cross-component correlations, which are not tailored for screen content sequences. To address this issue, this paper proposes a self-aware cross-component prediction method based on template for screen content coding. With the neighboring reference samples, four prediction models are derived, and chroma prediction values at the template are calculated with the models. The sum of absolute transformed difference (SATD) cost between chroma prediction values and chroma reconstruction values at the template is computed for each model. Subsequently, the model with the lowest SATD cost is determined to be the selected model, which is used to generate prediction values for the current chroma block. Notably, the selected model is adaptively determined at both the encoder and decoder sides consistently, without signaling a model index. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 0.73%, 1.62% and 1.75% bit-rate savings on Y, U and V components respectively over ECM 6.0, for class TGM (Text and Graphics with Motion) under All-Intra (AI) configuration.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558494","video coding;cross-component prediction;ECM;template;screen content coding","Video coding;Adaptation models;Costs;Correlation;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms","","1","","17","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the PPG pulses are generated in the arterial vessel approximately every second, and the morphological features of the continuous pulses are similar. The presence of repeated pulses can lead to over-training in BP prediction. This study proposes a clustering algorithm that to classify PPG pulses into specific clusters using PPG frequency domain features. In this study, the PPG pulses are processed using fast Fourier transform. Subsequently, the PPG frequency, amplitude, phase, real part, and imaginary part of the first to fourth frequency components are extracted. In the proposed K-Means algorithm, a novel distance function is developed to assess the dissimilarity between two pulses. In addition, a cluster center merging framework is proposed to overcome the challenge of selecting the K-value. The experiment utilized in the Medical Information Mart for IntensiveCare II (MIMIC-II) dataset, all the pulses are clustered and merged into 17 clusters. The results demonstrate that the proposed clustering method successfully identifies distinct PPG pulse clusters corresponding to different BP ranges.

Despite its potential, conventional CNN-based INR methods often encounter difficulties in modeling complex spatiotemporal scenes. This is primarily due to the inherent limitations of CNNs in extracting intricate information, particularly when it comes to capturing temporal dynamics. Consequently, the integration of spatiotemporal contextual information becomes imperative to enhance INR's capacity for scene modeling. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach, termed Vector Quantization Neural Representation (VQNeRV), specifically designed for video compression. Our methodology unfolds in three distinct stages: Firstly, we establish a CNN-based INR equipped with spatial embeddings to model the video content. Secondly, a Vector Quantization (VQ) encoder is then utilized to distill spatiotemporal features from the video. These features are subsequently amalgamated with the spatial embeddings through cross-attention mechanisms, facilitating a comprehensive feature fusion. Finally, an INR decoder, leveraging the combined features embodying spatiotemporal contextual information, reconstructs the video. Experimental results demonstrate that our method shows a much better rate-distortion performance compared to the VVC.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558613","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558613","Video Compression;Implicit Neual Representation;Vector Quantization","Training;Fuses;Vector quantization;Video sequences;Pipelines;Rate-distortion;Video compression","","","","22","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The state of these devices is typically read by applying a small DC voltage across the DUT and measuring the current flowing through it (or vice-versa). However, given their non-linear behaviour, a change in voltage across the device, albeit small, will result in a change in the measured resistance. This is undesirable when characterising these devices, as voltage drops due to metal routing or switches in the signal path will affect the measured resistance. This work puts forward the idea of closing the loop by sensing the voltage across the DUT through a Kelvin connection, and then making adjustments to the line voltage to compensate for any voltage drop. This in turn enables larger arrays, and a higher number of states to be read because of the increased precision. An on-chip CMOS design is proposed through the use of a dual-input-pair amplifier.

In current G-PCC, the prior information of spinning LiDAR is not fully utilized in octree geometry coding. In this paper, we address this issue and effectively account for the prior information of spinning LiDAR to improve the compression efficiency of octree geometry coding.

To tackle this problem, we propose a highly-programmable digital front-end IC in this paper to enable low-dark-current sensing in a PPG sensor with a novel MoSe2 photodiode. A programmable second-order continuous-time delta-sigma ADC utilizing 1.5-bit quantizer serves as the core of this front-end IC. Its programmable architecture allows a minimally detectable input current of 0.4 μA, leading to a state-of-the-art dynamic range of 140 dB. The proposed LDC is implemented in TSMC 0.18 μm process and achieves an average power consumption of 14.87 μW. The simulated SNDR with the transient noise is 80.1 dB .

The proposed method employs a model predictive controller (MPC) that can rapidly converge to an optimal set of stimulation parameters for a specific patient thanks to being pre-trained with a neural mass model (NMM) that is fine-tuned to the patient's pre-recorded data. The development and patientspecific customization of the NMM are presented, showing its ability to generate synthetic intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) with consistently-high spectral correlation to real prerecorded iEEG, for both normal and seizure periods (with a statistically-significant number of samples).

This paper presents the use of Quaternary Content-Addressable Memories (QCAMs), a generalization of the Ternary Content-Addressable Memories (TCAMs), for implementing boolean functions. Content-Addressable Memories can be used as a building block for in-memory processing, using the states of the cells to define a ${\mathbb{B}^{\text{N}}} \to {\mathbb{B}^{\text{M}}}$ function which projects the search word into a new string of bits. The quaternary alphabet allows to represent a more complex function space with respect to the TCAMs while using the same number of cells, enhancing area, power consumption and latency performances achieved when representing arbitrary functions with the CAM hardware. For comparison, it can be demonstrated that QCAMs represent arbitrary Boolean functions with half the number of cells than that would be needed in a standard TCAM implementation, and a ×10 smaller area with respect to SRAM-based LUTs. Along with the table of states and a toy example where the QCAM states are used to define the product among two 2-bit precision real values, this paper presents multiple circuit schemes and encoding schemes for memristor-based QCAMs.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558504","Arm; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558504","","Boolean functions;Power demand;Toy manufacturing industry;Redundancy;In-memory computing;Encoding;Hardware","","","","17","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This compute efficiency can be attributed in large part to the nature of analog computations and bio-inspired spiking data. However, the hardware implementation of a general-purpose or reconfigurable SRNN for neuromorphic computations poses challenges, especially pertaining to the programmable connectivity between neurons. This challenge becomes more pronounced when dealing with analog spikes, where information is encoded in the timing, width, shape, and frequency components of the spikes. Existing approaches to reconfigurable spike routing Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures are predominantly packet-based, falling short when preserving the majority of information within the spike. This becomes especially problematic for small-scale SRNNs, where these packet-based approaches lead to information loss while introducing unnecessary overhead, leading to increased power consumption and NoC implementation area on-chip. To address this challenge, this work introduces AnSpiCS-Net: Analog Spike routing Circuit Switched Network-on-Chip. AnSpiCS-Net utilizes a circuit-switching-based architecture with a Clos network topology, employing three distinct switch types: transmission gates, NMOS, and PMOS switches.

Here, a dimming control method based on multi-pulse pulse position modulation (MPPM) has been investigated to simultaneously achieve high-data-rate transmissions and dimming control. MPPM data is transmitted on r slots selected from the available ones. Dimming-control-based MPPM can also be realized by changing the value of r. When the dimming level changes, the data transmission rate changes, resulting in a significant degradation of the average data transmission efficiency averaged over the data transmission efficiency of each dimming stage of VR-MPPM. This paper proposes a selective VR-MPPM (SVR-MPPM) scheme to improve this average data transmission efficiency by selecting a value of r that achieves the highest possible transmission efficiency while satisfying a wide dimming range.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558266","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558266","Visible light communication;Dimming control;Pulse position modulation","Wireless communication;Degradation;Spectral efficiency;Circuits and systems;Measurement uncertainty;Modulation;Lighting","","","","21","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider a scenario in which there is one shared water resource among multiple farms as well as a water-sharing policy. It is required to irrigate all or some of these farms currently, but there is not enough water to properly irrigate them. This paper proposes a Multi-farm Irrigation Scheduling System, called MISS. The objective is to save the farms that need urgent irrigation while still satisfying all farm owners according to the water-sharing policy. MISS uses a two-level decision-making method where it considers a priority for the farms that need immediate irrigation as well as a priority for blocks of every farm. MISS is designed based on a realistic scenario where, because of the limited shared water, we sometimes are not able to save all the farms.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558460","Water management;smart irrigation;irrigation scheduling system and architecture","Irrigation;Circuits and systems;Decision making;Crops;Production;Water resources","","","","25","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, we propose a method that boosts the pixel domain performance of a model, by utilizing compressed domain knowledge via cross distillation between these two modalities. To evaluate our approach, we conduct experiments on two computer vision tasks which are object detection and recognition.

Visible light communication (VLC) is widely recognized as a promising solution to tackle this issue. Benefits from the rich spectrum resources and no electromagnetic interference radiation, VLC can be widely used in various indoor communication scenarios. However, the accessing of the existing network for the VLC system still remains a challenge. Thus, an optical fiber-based VLC structure is proposed to unlock traditional network cable transmission for the first time. Specifically, an optoelectronic media converter is designed to efficiently connect the fiber signal and the desired electrical signal. Moreover, an analog equalizer with low implementation complexity is exploited to extend the LED bandwidth, ensuring transmitted signals without distortion. It is worth noting that the VLC receiver adopts the auto gain control amplifier to meet the signal voltage requirement of the Ethernet physical layer. Experimental testbed is conducted and corresponding results demonstrated that the transmission rate of the proposed VLC system can reach 100Mbps with sufficiently low bit error rate. Therefore, this validates the capability of the proposed system to directly connect the VLC access point with the existing optical network facilities.","2158-1525","979-8-3503-3099-1","10.1109/ISCAS58744.2024.10558260","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10558260","Visible light communication;optical fiber;analog equalizer;LED driver","Optical fiber amplifiers;Equalizers;Optical fiber cables;Receivers;Optical fiber networks;Media;Physical layer","","","","16","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
